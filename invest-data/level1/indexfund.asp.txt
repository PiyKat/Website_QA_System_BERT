What Is an Index Fund ? . An index fund is a type of mutual fund with a portfolio constructed to match or track the components of a financial market index , such as the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index ( S&P 500 ) . An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure , low operating expenses and low portfolio turnover . These funds follow their benchmark index no matter the state of the markets .
--------------------------
What Is an Index Fund ? . Index funds are generally considered ideal core portfolio holdings for retirement accounts , such as individual retirement accounts ( IRAs ) and 401(k ) accounts . Legendary investor Warren Buffett has recommended index funds as a haven for savings for the sunset years of life . Rather than picking out individual stocks for investment , he has said , it makes more sense for the average investor to buy all of the S&P 500 companies at the low cost an index fund offers .
--------------------------
How an Index Fund Works . " Indexing " is a form of passive fund management . Instead of a fund portfolio manager actively stock picking and market timing — that is , choosing securities to invest in and strategizing when to buy and sell them — the fund manager builds a portfolio whose holdings mirror the securities of a particular index . The idea is that by mimicking the profile of the index — the stock market as a whole , or a broad segment of it — the fund will match its performance as well .
--------------------------
How an Index Fund Works . There is an index , and an index fund , for nearly every financial market in existence . In the U.S , the most popular index funds track the S&P 500 . But several other indexes are widely used as well , including :

How an Index Fund Works . So , an index fund tracking the DJIA , for example , would invest in the same 30 , large and publicly - owned companies that comprise that venerable index .
--------------------------
How an Index Fund Works . Portfolios of index funds substantially only change when their benchmark indexes change . If the fund is following a weighted index , its managers may periodically rebalance the percentage of different securities , to reflect the weight of their presence in the benchmark . Weighting is a method used to balance out the influence of any single holding in an index or a portfolio .

Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Investing in an index fund is a form of passive investing . The opposite strategy is active investing , as realized in actively managed mutual funds — the ones with the securities - picking , market - timing portfolio manager described above .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . One primary advantage that index funds possess over their actively managed counterparts is the lower management expense ratio . A fund 's expense ratio — also known as the management expense ratio — includes all of the operating expenses such as the payment to advisors and managers , transaction fees , taxes , and accounting fees .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Since the index fund managers are simply replicating the performance of a benchmark index , they do not need the services of research analysts and others that assist in the stock - selection process . Managers of index funds trade holdings less often incurring fewer transaction fees and commissions . In contrast , actively managed funds have bigger staffs and conduct more transactions , driving up the cost of doing business .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . The extra costs of fund management are reflected in the fund 's expense ratio and get passed on to investors . As a result , cheap index funds often cost less than a percent—0.2%-0.5 % is typical , with some firms offering even lower expense ratios of 0.05 % or less — compared to the much higher fees actively managed funds command — typically 1 % to 2.5 % .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Expense ratios directly impact the overall performance of a fund . Actively managed funds , with their often - higher expense ratios , are automatically at a disadvantage to index funds , and struggle to keep up with their benchmarks in terms of overall return .

Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Lowered expense leads to better performance . Advocates argue that passive funds have been successful in outperforming most actively managed mutual funds . It is true that a majority of mutual funds fail to beat broad indexes . For example , during the five years ending December 2018 , 82 % of large - cap funds generated a return less than the S&P 500 , according to SPIVA Scorecard data from S&P Dow Jones Indices .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . On the other hand , passively managed funds do not attempt to beat the market . Their strategy instead seeks to match the overall risk and return of the market — on the theory that the market always wins .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Passive management leading to positive performance tends to be true over the long term . With shorter timespans , active mutual funds do better . The SPIVA Scorecard indicates that in a span of one year , only 64 % of large - cap mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500 . In other words , over one - third of them beat it in the short term . Also , in other categories , actively managed money rules . As an example , nearly 85 % of mid - cap mutual funds beat their S&P MidCap 400 Growth Index benchmark , in the course of a year .
--------------------------
Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Even over the long term , when an actively managed fund is good , it is very , very good . Investor 's Business Daily 's " Best Mutual Funds 2019 " report lists dozens of funds that have racked up a 10-year average total return of 15 % to 19 % , compared to the S&P 500 's 13.12 % . They 've significantly outperformed the market in one- , three- , and five - year periods , too . Admittedly , this a feat that only 13 % of the 8,000 mutual funds out there can claim , as detailed in the report .
--------------------------
Real World Example of Index Funds . Index funds have been around since the 1970s . The popularity of passive investing , the appeal of low fees , and a long - running bull market have combined to send them soaring in the 2010s . For 2018 , according to Morningstar Research , investors poured more than US$ 458 billion into index funds across all asset classes . For the same period , actively managed funds experienced $ 301 billion in outflows .
--------------------------
Real World Example of Index Funds . The one fund that started it all , founded by Vanguard chairman John Bogle in 1976 , remains one of the best for its overall long - term performance and low cost . The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has tracked the S&P 500 faithfully , in composition and performance . It posts a one - year return of 9.46 % , vs. the index 's 9.5 % , as of March 2019 , for example . For its Admiral Shares , the expense ratio is 0.04 % , and its minimum investment is $ 3,000 .
