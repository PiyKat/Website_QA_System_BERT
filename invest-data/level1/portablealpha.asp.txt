What Is Portable Alpha ? . Portable alpha is a strategy in which portfolio managers separate alpha from beta by investing in securities that are not in the market index from which their beta is derived . Alpha is the return achieved over and above the market return ( beta ) without taking on more risk . In simple terms , portable alpha is a strategy that involves investing in areas that have little to no correlation with the market .
--------------------------
Portable Alpha Explained . Portfolio returns come from two sources . The first source is systematic and is often referred to as beta . Beta is the extent to which an investment vehicle moves with the market and is therefore also a measure of volatility . A fund with a beta of 1.0 moves up and down with the movement of the market . A fund with a beta of 0.5 moves up and down only half as much as the market , and one with a beta of 1.5 moves up and down 1.5 times as much as the market . Beta can be said to represent passive returns , or returns that result from the movement of the market as a whole .
--------------------------
Portable Alpha Explained . The second source is idiosyncratic , specific to the movement of individual stocks ( or other securities ) . This is represented by alpha , which is a measure of returns resulting from selecting some securities over others , or from other forms of active management .
--------------------------
Portable Alpha Explained . A portfolio manager can achieve portable alpha by investing in securities that are not correlated with the beta . Typically , the goal with portable alpha is to achieve this alpha without affecting the beta , or volatility , of the overall portfolio .
--------------------------
Example of Portable Alpha Strategy . A portable alpha strategy , for example , might involve investing in large - cap stocks to get the beta or market return , and investing in small - cap equities to achieve alpha . But since small caps are more volatile than large caps , the overall beta will be higher . To neutralize this higher beta , the small - cap strategy could be hedged with futures on a small - cap index , thereby returning the beta of the overall strategy , large caps , and small caps , to its original level .
