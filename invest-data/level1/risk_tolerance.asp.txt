Risk Tolerance . Risk tolerance is a topic that is often discussed but rarely defined . It is not unusual to read a trade recommendation discussing alternatives or options based on different risk tolerances . But how does an individual investor determine his or her risk tolerance ? How can understanding this concept help investors in diversifying their portfolios ?
--------------------------
Risk Tolerance by Time Frame . An often seen cliché is that of what we 'll refer to as " age - based " risk tolerance . It is conventional wisdom that a younger investor has a long - term time horizon in terms of the need for investments and can take more risk . Following this logic , an older individual has a short investment horizon , especially once that individual is retired , and would have a low - risk tolerance . While this may be true in general , there are certainly a number of other considerations that come into play .
--------------------------
Risk Tolerance by Time Frame . First , we need to consider the investment . When will funds be needed ? If the time horizon is relatively short , risk tolerance should shift to be more conservative . For long - term investments , there is room for more aggressive investing .
--------------------------
Risk Tolerance by Time Frame . Be careful , however , about blindly following conventional wisdom when it comes to risk tolerance and asset classes . For example , do n't think that just because you are 65 that you must shift everything to conservative investments , such as certificates of deposit or Treasury bills . While this may be appropriate for some , it may not be appropriate for all — such as for an individual who has enough to retire and live off of the interest of his or her investments without touching the principal . With today 's growing life expectancies and advancing medical science , the 65-year - old investor may still have a 20-year ( or more ) time horizon .
--------------------------
Risk Capital . Net worth and available risk capital should be important considerations when determining risk tolerance . Net worth is simply your assets minus your liabilities . Risk capital is money available to invest or trade that will not affect your lifestyle if lost . It should be defined as liquid capital or capital that can easily be converted into cash .
--------------------------
Risk Capital . Therefore , an investor or trader with a high net worth can assume more risk . The smaller the percentage of your overall net worth the investment or trade makes up , the more aggressive the risk tolerance can be .
--------------------------
Risk Capital . Unfortunately , those with little to no net worth or with limited risk capital are often drawn to riskier investments like futures or options because of the lure of quick , easy and large profits . The problem with this is that when you are " trading with the rent " it is difficult to have your head in the game . Also , when too much risk is assumed with too little capital , a trader can be forced out of a position too early .
--------------------------
Risk Capital . On the other hand , if an undercapitalized trader using limited or defined risk instruments ( such as long options ) " goes bust , " it may not take that trader long to recover . Contrast this with the high - net - worth trader who puts everything into one risky trade and loses — it will take this trader much longer to recover .
--------------------------
. A high - net - worth individual likely has more money to risk and can , therefore , be more risk - tolerant than someone with less capital , but that person also has more to lose should the investment go bust .
--------------------------
Understand Your Investment Goals . Your investment objectives must also be considered when calculating how much risk can be assumed . If you are saving for a child 's college education or your retirement , how much risk do you really want to take with those funds ? Conversely , more risk could be taken if you are using true risk capital or disposable income to attempt to earn extra income .
--------------------------
Understand Your Investment Goals . Interestingly , some people seem quite alright with using retirement funds to trade higher - risk instruments . If you are doing this for the sole purpose of sheltering the trades from tax exposure , such as trading futures in an IRA , make sure you fully understand what you are doing . Such a strategy may be alright if you are experienced with trading futures , are using only a portion of your IRA funds for this purpose and are not risking your ability to retire on a single trade .
--------------------------
Understand Your Investment Goals . However , if you are applying your entire IRA to futures , have little or no net worth and are just trying to avoid tax exposure for that " sure thing " trade , you need to rethink the notion of taking on this much risk . Futures already receive favorable capital gains treatment ; capital gains rates are lower than for regular income , and 60 % of your gains in futures will be charged the lower of the two capital gains rates . With this in mind , why would a low net worth individual need to take that much risk with retirement funds ? In other words , just because you can do something does n't always mean you should .
--------------------------
. Just because you can make riskier bets does n't mean you should ; if preservation of capital is the goal and you are newer to investing , be wary of taking on too much risk .
--------------------------
Investment Experience . When it comes to determining your risk tolerance , your level of investing experience must also be considered . Are you new to investing and trading ? Have you been doing this for some time but are branching into a new area , like selling options ? It is prudent to begin new ventures with some degree of caution , and trading or investing is no different . Get some experience under your belt before committing too much capital . Always remember the old cliché and strive for " preservation of capital . " It only makes sense to take on the appropriate risk for your situation if the worst - case scenario will leave you able to live to fight another day .
--------------------------
Careful Consideration . There are many things to consider when determining the answer to a seemingly simple question , " What is my risk tolerance ? " The answer will vary based on your age , experience , net worth , risk capital and the actual investment or trade being considered . Once you have thought this through , you will be able to apply this knowledge to a balanced and diversified program of investing and trading .
--------------------------
Careful Consideration . Spreading your risk around , even if it is all high risk , decreases your overall exposure to any single investment or trade . With appropriate diversification , the probability of total loss is greatly reduced . This comes back to the preservation of capital .
--------------------------
Careful Consideration . Knowing your risk tolerance goes far beyond being able to sleep at night or stressing over your trades . It is a complex process of analyzing your personal financial situation and balancing it against your goals and objectives . Ultimately , knowing your risk tolerance – and keeping to investments that fit within it – should keep you from complete financial ruin .
