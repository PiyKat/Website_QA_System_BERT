What Is Active Risk ? . Active risk is a type of risk that a fund or managed portfolio creates as it attempts to beat the returns of the benchmark against which it is compared . Risk characteristics of a fund versus its benchmark provide insight on a fund ’s active risk .
--------------------------
Understanding Active Risk . Active risk is the risk a manager takes on in their efforts to outperform a benchmark and achieve higher returns for investors . Actively - managed funds will have risk characteristics that vary from their benchmark . Generally , passively - managed funds seek to have limited or no active risk in comparison to the benchmark they seek to replicate .
--------------------------
Understanding Active Risk . Active risk can be observed through comparison of multiple risk characteristics . Three of the best risk metrics for active risk comparisons include beta , standard deviation or volatility , and Sharpe Ratio . Beta represents a fund ’s risk relative to its benchmark . A fund beta greater than one indicates higher risk while a fund beta below one indicates lower risk . Standard deviation or volatility expresses the variation of the underlying securities comprehensively . A fund volatility measure that is higher than the benchmark shows higher risk while a fund volatility below the benchmark shows lower risk . The Sharpe Ratio provides a measure for understanding the excess return as a function of the risk . A higher Sharpe Ratio means a fund is investing more efficiently by earning higher return per unit of risk . ( See also : 5 Ways to Measure Mutual Fund Risk )
--------------------------
Measuring Active Risk . There are two generally accepted methodologies for calculating active risk . Depending on which method is used , active risk can be positive or negative . The first method for calculating active risk is to subtract the benchmark 's return from the investment 's return . For example , if a mutual fund returned 8 % over the course of a year while its relevant benchmark index returned 5 % , the active risk would be :
--------------------------
Measuring Active Risk . This shows that 3 % of additional return was gained from either active security selection , market timing or a combination of both . In this example , the active risk has a positive effect . However , had the investment returned less than 5 % , the active risk would be negative , indicating that security selections and/or market - timing decisions that deviated from the benchmark were poor decisions .
--------------------------
Measuring Active Risk . The second way to calculate active risk , and the one more often used , is to take the standard deviation of the difference of investment and benchmark returns over time . The formula is :
--------------------------
Measuring Active Risk . For example , assume the following annual returns for a mutual fund and its benchmark index :
--------------------------
Measuring Active Risk . The differences equal :
--------------------------
Measuring Active Risk . The square root of the sum of the differences squared , divided by ( N - 1 ) equals the active risk ( where N = the number of periods ) :

Example of Active Risk Analysis . The Oppenheimer Global Opportunities Fund is an example of a fund that has been outperforming its benchmark with active risk . The Oppenheimer Global Opportunities Fund is an actively managed fund that seeks to invest in both U.S. and foreign stocks . It uses the MSCI All Country World Index as its benchmark . As of December 11 , 2017 it has a one year return of 48.64 % versus a return of 21.64 % for the MSCI All Country World Index .
--------------------------
Example of Active Risk Analysis . Its December 11 net asset value was $ 66.81 . The Fund has a gross and net expense ratio of 1.17 % .

Example of Active Risk Analysis . Risk metrics for active risk comparison are below and are reported as of November 30 , 2017 .

Example of Active Risk Analysis . The Fund 's beta and standard deviation show the active risk added in comparison to the benchmark . The Sharpe Ratio shows that the Fund is generating higher excess return per unit of risk than the benchmark .
--------------------------
Active Risk vs. Residual Risk . Residual risk is company - specific risks , such as strikes , outcomes of legal proceedings or natural disasters . This risk is known as diversifiable risk , since it can be eliminated by sufficiently diversifying a portfolio . There is n't a formula for calculating residual risk ; instead , it must be extrapolated by subtracting the systematic risk from the total risk .
--------------------------
Active Risk vs. Residual Risk . Active risk arises through portfolio management decisions that deviate a portfolio or investment away from its passive benchmark . Active risk comes directly from human or software decisions . Active risk is created by taking an active investment strategy instead of a completely passive one . Residual risk is inherent to every single company and is not associated with broader market movements .
--------------------------
Active Risk vs. Residual Risk . Active risk and residual risk are fundamentally two different types of risks that can be managed or eliminated , though in different ways . To eliminate active risk , follow a purely passive investment strategy . To eliminate residual risk , invest in a sufficiently large number of different companies inside and outside of the company 's industry .
