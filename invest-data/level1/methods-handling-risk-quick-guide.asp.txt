5 Basic Methods for Risk Management . As people begin to age , they usually encounter more health risks . Managing pure risk entails the process of identifying , evaluating and subjugating these risks – a defensive strategy to prepare for the unexpected . The basic methods for risk management – avoidance , retention , sharing , transferring , and loss prevention and reduction – can apply to all facets of an individual 's life and can pay off in the long run . Here 's a look at these five methods and how they can apply to managing health risks .
--------------------------
Avoidance . Avoidance is a method for mitigating risk by not participating in activities that may incur injury , sickness or death . Smoking cigarettes is an example of one such activity because avoiding it may lessen both health and financial risks .
--------------------------
Avoidance . According to the American Lung Association , smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and claims more than 438,000 lives per year . Additionally , the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention notes that smoking is the No . 1 risk factor for getting lung cancer , and the risk only increases the longer that people smoke .
--------------------------
Avoidance . Life insurance companies mitigate this risk on their end by raising premiums for smokers than nonsmokers . Under the Affordable Health Care Act , also known as Obamacare , health insurers are able to increase premiums based on age , geography , family size and smoking status . The law allows for up to a 50 % surcharge on premiums for smokers .
--------------------------
Retention . Retention is the acknowledgment and acceptance of a risk as a given . Usually , this accepted risk is a cost to help offset larger risks down the road , such as opting to select a lower premium health insurance plan that carries a higher deductible rate . The initial risk is the cost of having to pay more out - of - pocket medical expenses if health issues arise . If the issue becomes more serious or life - threatening , then the health insurance benefits are available to cover most of the costs beyond the deductible . If the individual has no serious health issues warranting any additional medical expenses for the year , then they avoid the out - of - pocket payments , mitigating the larger risk altogether .
--------------------------
Sharing . Sharing risk is often implemented through employer - based benefits that allow the company to pay a portion of insurance premiums with the employee . In essence , this shares the risk with the company and all employees participating in the insurance benefits . The understanding is that with more participants sharing the risks , the costs of premiums should shrink proportionately . Individuals may find it in their best interest to participate in sharing the risk by choosing employer health care and life insurance plans when possible .
--------------------------
Transferring . The use of health insurance is an example of transferring risk because the financial risks associated with health care are transferred from the individual to the insurer . Insurance companies assume the financial risk in exchange for a fee known as a premium and a documented contract between the insurer and individual . The contract states all the stipulations and conditions that must be met and maintained for the insurer to take on the financial responsibility of covering the risk .
--------------------------
Transferring . By accepting the terms and conditions and paying the premiums , an individual has managed to transfer most , if not all , the risk to the insurer . The insurer carefully applies many statistics and algorithms to accurately determine the proper premium payments commensurate to the requested coverage . When claims are made , the insurer confirms whether the conditions are met to provide the contractual payout for the risk outcome .
--------------------------
Loss Prevention and Reduction . This method of risk management attempts to minimize the loss , rather than completely eliminate it . While accepting the risk , it stays focused on keeping the loss contained and preventing it from spreading . An example of this in health insurance is preventative care .
--------------------------
Loss Prevention and Reduction . Health insurers encourage preventative care visits , often free of co - pays , where members can receive annual checkups and physical examinations . Insurers understand that spotting potential health issues early on and administering preventative care can help minimize medical costs in the long run . Many health plans also provide discounts to gyms and health clubs as another means of prevention and reduction in order to keep members active and healthy .
