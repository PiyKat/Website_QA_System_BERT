What Is Annualized Total Return ? . An annualized total return is the geometric average amount of money earned by an investment each year over a given time period . The annualized return formula is calculated as a geometric average to show what an investor would earn over a period of time if the annual return was compounded . An annualized total return provides only a snapshot of an investment 's performance and does not give investors any indication of its volatility or price fluctuations .
--------------------------
Understanding Annualized Total Return . To understand annualized total return , we 'll compare the hypothetical performances of two mutual funds . Below is the annualized rate of return over a five - year period for the two funds :
--------------------------
Understanding Annualized Total Return . Mutual Fund A Returns : 3 % , 7 % , 5 % , 12 % and 1 %
--------------------------
Understanding Annualized Total Return . Mutual Fund B Returns : 4 % , 6 % , 5 % , 6 % , and 6.7 %
--------------------------
Understanding Annualized Total Return . Both mutual funds have an annualized rate of return of 5.5 % , but Mutual Fund A is much more volatile . Its standard deviation is 4.2 % , while Mutual Fund B 's standard deviation is only 1 % . Even when analyzing an investment 's annualized return , it is important to review risk statistics .
--------------------------
Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . The formula to calculate annualized rate of return needs only two variables : the returns for a given period of time and the time the investment was held . The formula is :
--------------------------
Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . For example , take the annual rates of returns of Mutual Fund A above . An analyst substitutes each of the " r " variables with the appropriate return , and " n " with the number of years the investment was held . In this case , five years . The annualized return of Mutual Fund A is calculated as :
--------------------------
Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . Annualized Return = ( ( 1 + 3 % ) x ( 1 + 7 % ) x ( 1 + 5 % ) x ( 1 + 12 % ) x ( 1 + 1 % ) ) ^ ( 1 / 5 ) -1 = 130.9 % ^ ( 0.20 ) -1 = 105.55 % - 1 = 5.53 %
--------------------------
Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . An annualized return does not have to be limited to yearly returns . If an investor has a cumulative return for a given period , even if it is a specific number of days , an annualized performance figure can be calculated ; however , the annual return formula must be slightly adjusted to :
--------------------------
Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . For example , assume a mutual fund was held by an investor for 575 days and earned a cumulative return of 23.74 % . The annualized rate of return would be :
--------------------------
Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . Annualized Return = ( 1 + 23.74 % ) ^ ( 365 / 575 ) - 1 = 114.5 % - 1 = 14.5 %
--------------------------
Difference Between Annualized Return and Average Return . Calculations of simple averages only work when numbers are independent of each other . The annualized return is used because the amount of investment lost or gained in a given year is interdependent with the amount from the other years under consideration because of compounding . For example , if a mutual fund manager loses half of her client 's money , she has to make a 100 % return to break even . Using the more accurate annualized return also gives a clearer picture when comparing various mutual funds or the return of stocks that have traded over different time periods .
--------------------------
Reporting Annualized Return . According to the Global Investment Performance Standards ( GIPS ) , a set of standardized , industry - wide principles that guide the ethics of performance reporting , any investment that does not have a track record of at least 365 days can not " ratchet up " its performance to be annualized . Thus , if a fund has been operating for only six months and earned 5 % , it is not allowed to say its annualized performance is approximately 10 % since that is predicting future performance instead of stating facts from the past . In other words , calculating an annualized rate of return must be based on historical numbers .
