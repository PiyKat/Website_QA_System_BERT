What Was the Subprime Meltdown ? . The subprime meltdown was the sharp increase in high - risk mortgages that went into default beginning in 2007 , contributing to the most severe recession in decades . The housing boom of the mid-2000s — combined with low interest rates at the time — prompted many lenders to offer home loans to individuals with poor credit . When the real estate bubble burst , many borrowers were unable to make payments on their subprime mortgages .

Subprime Meltdown Explained . Following the tech bubble and the economic trauma that followed the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11 , 2001 , the Federal Reserve stimulated the struggling U.S. economy by cutting interest rates to historically low levels . As a result , the housing market soared for several years . To capitalize on the home - buying frenzy , some lenders extended mortgages to those who could not otherwise qualify for traditional loans because of a weak credit history or other disqualifying credit measures . This period even sparked the NINJA loan : no income , no job , no asset — no problem , money was easy flowing . Investment firms were eager to buy these loans and repackage them as mortgage - backed securities ( MBSs ) and other structured credit products .

Subprime Meltdown Explained . Many subprime mortgages were adjustable - rate loans with reasonable interest rates but could reset to a dramatically higher interest rate after a given period . And they did when credit and liquidity dried up during the teeth of the Great Recession . This sudden increase in mortgage rates played a major role in the growing number of defaults , starting in 2007 and peaking in 2009 . Significant job losses throughout the economy did not help ; as many borrowers were losing their jobs , their mortgage payment was going up at the same time . Without a job , it was nearly impossible to refinance the mortgage with a lower fixed rate . The ensuing meltdown caused dozens of banks to go bankrupt and led to enormous losses on Wall Street and hedge funds that marketed or invested heavily in risky mortgage - related securities . The fallout was a major contributor to the lengthy economic downturn that followed .

Placing Blame for the Subprime Meltdown . In the wake of the subprime meltdown , myriad sources have received blame . These include mortgage brokers and investment firms that offered loans to people traditionally seen as high - risk , as well as credit agencies that proved overly optimistic about non - traditional loans . Critics also targeted mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which encouraged loose lending standards by buying or guaranteeing hundreds of billions of risky loans .
