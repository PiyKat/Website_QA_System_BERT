What is Volatility ? . Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index . In most cases , the higher the volatility , the riskier the security . Volatility is often measured as either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index .
--------------------------
What is Volatility ? . In the securities markets , volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction . For example , when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time , it is called a " volatile " market . An asset 's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts .
--------------------------
Volatility Explained . Volatility often refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk related to the size of changes in a security 's value . A higher volatility means that a security 's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values . This means that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction . A lower volatility means that a security 's value does not fluctuate dramatically , and tends to be more steady .
--------------------------
Volatility Explained . One way to measure an asset 's variation is to quantify the daily returns ( percent move on a daily basis ) of the asset . Historical volatility is based on historical prices and represents the degree of variability in the returns of an asset . This number is without a unit and is expressed as a percentage . While variance captures the dispersion of returns around the mean of an asset in general , volatility is a measure of that variance bounded by a specific period of time . Thus , we can report daily volatility , weekly , monthly , or annualized volatility . It is therefore useful to think of volatility as the annualized standard deviation : Volatility = √ ( variance annualized )
--------------------------
How to Calculate Volatility . Volatility is often calculated using variance and standard deviation . The standard deviation is the square root of the variance .
--------------------------
How to Calculate Volatility . For simplicity , let 's assume we have monthly stock closing prices of $ 1 through $ 10 . For example , month one is $ 1 , month two is $ 2 , and so on . To calculate variance , follow the five steps below .
--------------------------
How to Calculate Volatility . In this case , the resulting variance is $ 8.25 . The square root is taken to get the standard deviation . This equals $ 2.87 . This is a measure of risk , and shows how values are spread out around the average price . It gives traders an idea of how far the price may deviate from the average .
--------------------------
How to Calculate Volatility . If prices are randomly distributed ( and often they are not ) , then about 68 % off all data values will fall within one standard deviation . 95 % of data values will fall within two standard deviations ( 2 x 2.87 in our example ) , and 99.7 % of all values will fall within three standard deviations ( 3 x 2.87 ) . In this case , the values of $ 1 to $ 10 are not randomly distribute on a bell curve , rather there is a significant upward bias . Therefore , all the values do not fall within three standard deviations . Despite this limitation , standard deviation is still frequently used by traders , as price data sets often contain up and down movements , which resemble more of a random distribution .

Other Measures of Volatility . One measure of the relative volatility of a particular stock to the market is its beta ( β ) . A beta approximates the overall volatility of a security 's returns against the returns of a relevant benchmark ( usually the S&P 500 is used ) . For example , a stock with a beta value of 1.1 has historically moved 110 % for every 100 % move in the benchmark , based on price level . Conversely , a stock with a beta of .9 has historically moved 90 % for every 100 % move in the underlying index .
--------------------------
Other Measures of Volatility . Market volatility can also be seen through the VIX or Volatility Index . The VIX was created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a measure to gauge the 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. stock market derived from real - time quote prices of S&P 500 call and put options . It is effectively a gauge of future bets investors and traders are making on the direction of the markets or individual securities . A high reading on the VIX implies a risky market .
--------------------------
Other Measures of Volatility . A variable in option pricing formulas showing the extent to which the return of the underlying asset will fluctuate between now and the option 's expiration . Volatility , as expressed as a percentage coefficient within option - pricing formulas , arises from daily trading activities . How volatility is measured will affect the value of the coefficient used .
--------------------------
Other Measures of Volatility . Volatility is also used to price options contracts using models like Black - Scholes or binomial tree models . More volatile underlying assets will translate to higher options premiums , because with volatility there is a greater probability that the options will end up in - the - money at expiration . Options traders try to predict an asset 's future volatility and so the price of an option in the market reflects its implied volatility .
--------------------------
Real World Example of Volatility . Suppose that an investor is building a retirement portfolio . Since she is retiring within the next few years , she 's seeking stocks with low volatility and steady returns .
--------------------------
Real World Example of Volatility . She considers two companies :
--------------------------
Real World Example of Volatility . The investor would likely choose Microsoft Corporation for their portfolio since it has less volatility and more predictable short - term value . ( For related reading , see " How to Bet on Volatility When the VXX Expires " )
--------------------------
Implied Volatility vs. Historical Volatility . Implied volatility ( IV ) , also known as projected volatility , is one of the most important metrics for options traders . As the name suggests , it allows them to make a determination of just how volatile the market will be going forward . This concept also gives traders a way to calculate probability . One important point to note is that it should n't be considered science , so it does n't provide a forecast of how the market will move in the future .
--------------------------
Implied Volatility vs. Historical Volatility . Unlike historical volatility , implied volatility comes from the price of an option itself and represents volatility expectations for the future . Because it is implied , traders can not use past performance as an indicator of future performance . Instead , they have to estimate the potential of the option in the market .
--------------------------
Implied Volatility vs. Historical Volatility . Also referred to as statistical volatility , historical volatility ( HV ) gauges the fluctuations of underlying securities by measuring price changes over predetermined periods of time . It is the less prevalent metric compared to implied volatility because it is n't forward - looking .
--------------------------
Implied Volatility vs. Historical Volatility . When there is a rise in historical volatility , a security 's price will also move more than normal . At this time , there is an expectation that something will or has changed . If the historical volatility is dropping , on the other hand , it means any uncertainty has been eliminated , so things return to the way they were .
--------------------------
Implied Volatility vs. Historical Volatility . This calculation may be based on intraday changes , but often measures movements based on the change from one closing price to the next . Depending on the intended duration of the options trade , historical volatility can be measured in increments ranging anywhere from 10 to 180 trading days .
