What Is Risk Capital ? . Risk capital refers to funds allocated to speculative activity and used for high - risk , high - reward investments . Diversification is key for successful investment of risk capital , as the prospects of each investment tends to be uncertain by nature although the returns can be far above average when an investment succeeds . Moreover , an investor needs to ensure that only a portion of total capital is considered risk capital . In the context of venture capital , risk capital may also refer to funds invested in a promising , but unproven , startup .
--------------------------
Understanding Risk Capital . Risk capital is the funds that are expendable in exchange for the opportunity to generate outsized gains . Investors must be willing to lose all of their risk capital and it should only account for 10 % or less of a typical investor 's portfolio equity . Experienced investors with high risk tolerance may allocate a quarter or more of their portfolio to higher risk investment . That said , any investments made with risk capital should be offset with more stable diversified investments or you face the possibility of losing your entire portfolio .
--------------------------
Understanding Risk Capital . The more risk averse the investor , the lower the proportion of risk capital allocated in the total portfolio should be . While young investors , because of their lengthy investment horizons , can have a very significant proportion of risk capital in their portfolios , retirees are not usually comfortable with a high proportion of risk capital - nor should they be as their time to make back losses is limited . Generally speaking , speculative investing should be segmented to the early years of investing and cordoned off as retirement age approaches .
