What Is a Bell Curve ? . A bell curve is the most common type of distribution for a variable and is thus considered to be a normal distribution . The term " bell curve " originates from the fact that the graph used to depict a normal distribution consists of a bell - shaped line . The highest point on the curve , or the top of the bell , represents the most probable event in a series of data , while all other possible occurrences are equally distributed around the most probable event , creating a downward - sloping line on each side of the peak .
--------------------------
What Does a Bell Curve Tell You ? . The term bell curve is used to describe a graphical depiction of a normal probability distribution , whose underlying standard deviations from the mean create the curved bell shape . A standard deviation is a measurement used to quantify the variability of data dispersion , in a set of given values . The " mean " refers to the average of all data points in the data set or sequence .
--------------------------
What Does a Bell Curve Tell You ? . Financial analysts and investors often use a normal probability distribution when analyzing the returns of a security or of overall market sensitivity . In finance , standard deviations that depict the returns of a security are known as volatility .
--------------------------
What Does a Bell Curve Tell You ? . For example , stocks that display a bell curve are normally blue - chip stocks and ones that have lower volatility and more predictable behavioral patterns . Investors use the normal probability distribution of a stock 's past returns to make assumptions regarding expected future returns .

What Does a Bell Curve Tell You ? . In addition to teachers who use a bell curve when comparing test scores , the bell curve is often also used in the world of statistics where it can be widely applied . Bell curves are also sometimes employed in performance management , placing employees who perform their job in an average fashion in the normal distribution of the graph . The high performers and the lowest performers are represented on either side with the dropping slope . It can be useful to larger companies when doing performance reviews or when making managerial decisions .
--------------------------
Example of How to Use a Bell Curve . A bell curve uses standard deviations , which are calculated after the mean is calculated , and represent a percentage of the total data collected . On a bell curve , for example , if 100 test scores are collected and used in a normal probability distribution , 68 % of those test scores should fall within one standard deviation above or below the mean . Moving two standard deviations away from the mean should include 95 % of the 100 test scores collected . Moving three standard deviations away from the mean should represent 99.7 % of the scores .
--------------------------
Example of How to Use a Bell Curve . Test scores that are extreme outliers , such as a score of 100 or 0 , would be considered long - tail data points that consequently lie squarely outside of the three standard deviation range .
--------------------------
. A bell curve should be symmetrical in shape .
--------------------------
The Difference Between a Bell Curve and Non - Normal Distributions . The normal probability distribution assumption does nâ€™t always hold true in the financial world , however . It is feasible for stocks and other securities to sometimes display non - normal distributions that fail to resemble a bell curve .
--------------------------
The Difference Between a Bell Curve and Non - Normal Distributions . Non - normal distributions have fatter tails than a bell curve ( normal probability ) distribution . A fatter tail that skews negative signals to investors that there is a greater probability of negative returns .
--------------------------
Limitations of Using a Bell Curve . Grading or assessing performance using a bell curve forces groups of people to be categorized as poor , average , or good . For smaller groups , having to categorize a set number of individuals in each category to fit a bell curve will do a disservice to the individuals . As sometimes they may all be just average or even good workers or students , but given the need to fit their rating or grades to a bell curve , some individuals are forced into the poor group .
