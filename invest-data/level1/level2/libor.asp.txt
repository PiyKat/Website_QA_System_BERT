What Is London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) ? . The London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) is a benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short - term loans .
--------------------------
What Is London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) ? . LIBOR , which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate , serves as a globally accepted key benchmark interest rate that indicates borrowing costs between banks . The rate is calculated and published each day by the Intercontinental Exchange ( ICE ) .
--------------------------
Understanding LIBOR . LIBOR is the average interest rate at which major global banks borrow from one another . It is based on five currencies including the US dollar , the euro , the British pound , the Japanese yen , and the Swiss franc , and serves seven different maturities — overnight / spot next , one week , and one , two , three , six , and 12 months .
--------------------------
Understanding LIBOR . The combination of five currencies and seven maturities leads to a total of 35 different LIBOR rates calculated and reported each business day . The most commonly quoted rate is the three - month U.S. dollar rate , usually referred to as the current LIBOR rate .
--------------------------
Understanding LIBOR . Each day , ICE asks major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short - term loans . The association takes out the highest and lowest figures , then calculates the average from the remaining numbers . This is known as the trimmed average . This rate is posted each morning as the daily rate , so it 's not a static figure . Once the rates for each maturity and currency are calculated and finalized , they are announced / published once a day at around 11:55 am London time by IBA .
--------------------------
Understanding LIBOR . LIBOR is also the basis for consumer loans in countries around the world , so it impacts consumers just as much as it does financial institutions . The interest rates on various credit products such as credit cards , car loans , and adjustable rate mortgages fluctuate based on the interbank rate . This change in rate helps determine the ease of borrowing between banks and consumers .
--------------------------
Understanding LIBOR . But there is a downside to using the LIBOR rate . Even though lower borrowing costs may be attractive to consumers , it does also affect the returns on certain securities . Some mutual funds may be attached to LIBOR , so their yields may drop as LIBOR fluctuates .
--------------------------
How Is LIBOR Calculated ? . The ICE Benchmark Administration ( IBA ) has constituted a designated panel of global banks for each currency and tenor pair . For example , 16 major banks , including Bank of America , Barclays , Citibank , Deutsche Bank , JPMorgan Chase , and UBS constitute the panel for US dollar LIBOR . Only those banks that have a significant role in the London market are considered eligible for membership on the ICE LIBOR panel , and the selection process is held annually .
--------------------------
How Is LIBOR Calculated ? . As of April 2018 , the IBA submitted a new proposal to strengthen the LIBOR calculation methodology . It suggested using a standardized , transaction - based , data - driven , layered method called the Waterfall Methodology for determining LIBOR .
--------------------------
. The Waterfall Methodology retains the trimmed average calculation .
--------------------------
. The IBA calculates the LIBOR rate using a trimmed mean approach applied to all the responses received . Trimmed mean is a method of averaging which eliminates a small specified percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean . For LIBOR , figures in the highest and lowest quartile are thrown out and averaging is performed on the remaining numbers .
--------------------------
Uses of LIBOR . LIBOR is used worldwide in a wide variety of financial products . They include the following :
--------------------------
Uses of LIBOR . LIBOR is also used as a standard gauge of market expectation for interest rates finalized by central banks . It accounts for the liquidity premiums for various instruments traded in the money markets , as well as an indicator of the health of the overall banking system . A lot of derivative products are created , launched and traded in reference to LIBOR . LIBOR is also used as a reference rate for other standard processes like clearing , price discovery , and product valuation .
--------------------------
A Brief History of LIBOR . The need for a uniform measure of interest rates across financial institutions became necessary as the market for interest rate - based products began evolving during the 1980s . The British Bankers ’ Association ( BBA)—which represented the banking and financial services industry — set up BBA interest - settlement rates in 1984 . Further streamlining led to the evolution of BBA LIBOR in 1986 , which became the default standard interest rate for transacting in the interest rate- and currency - based financial dealings between financial institutions at the local and international levels .
--------------------------
A Brief History of LIBOR . Since then , LIBOR has undergone many changes . The major one is when BBA LIBOR changed to ICE LIBOR in February 2014 after the Intercontinental Exchange took over the administration .
--------------------------
A Brief History of LIBOR . Currencies involved in calculating LIBOR have also changed . While new currency rates have been added , many have been removed or integrated following the introduction of the euro rates . The 2008 financial crisis saw a significant decline in the number of tenors for which LIBOR was calculated .
--------------------------
LIBOR Equivalents . Though LIBOR is accepted globally , there are other similar regional interest rates that are popularly followed across the globe .
--------------------------
LIBOR Equivalents . For instance , Europe has the European Interbank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR ) , Japan has the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ( TIBOR ) , China has Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate ( SHIBOR ) , and India has the Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate ( MIBOR ) .
--------------------------
LIBOR Scandal of Rate Rigging . While LIBOR has been a long - established global benchmark standard for interest rate , it has had its fair share of controversies including a major scandal of rate rigging . Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate the LIBOR rates . They took traders ' requests into account and submitted artificially low LIBOR rates to keep them at their preferred levels . The intention behind the alleged malpractice was to bump up traders ’ profits who were holding positions in LIBOR - based financial securities .
--------------------------
LIBOR Scandal of Rate Rigging . Following reporting by the Wall Street Journal in 2008 , major global banks which were on the panels and contributed to the LIBOR determination process faced regulatory scrutiny . It involved investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice . Similar investigations were launched in other parts of the globe including in the U.K. and Europe . Major banks and financial institutions including Barclays , ICAP , Rabobank , Royal Bank of Scotland , UBS , and Deutsche Bank faced heavy fines . Punitive actions were also taken on their employees who were found to be involved in the malpractice .
--------------------------
LIBOR Scandal of Rate Rigging . The scandal was also one of the primary reasons why LIBOR shifted from BBA administration to ICE .
--------------------------
Examples of LIBOR - Based Products and Transactions . The simplest example of a LIBOR - based transaction is a floating rate bond which pays an annual interest based on LIBOR , says at LIBOR + 0.5 % . As the value of LIBOR changes , the interest payment will change .
--------------------------
Examples of LIBOR - Based Products and Transactions . LIBOR also applies to interest rate swaps — contractual agreements between two parties to exchange interest payments at a specified time . Assume Paul owns a $ 1 million investment that pays him a variable LIBOR - based interest rate equal to LIBOR + 1 % each quarter . Since his earnings are subject to LIBOR values and are variable in nature , he wants to switch to fixed - rate interest payments . Then there is Peter , who has a similar $ 1 million investment which pays him a fixed interest of 1.5 % per quarter . He wishes to get a variable earning , as it may occasionally give him higher payments .
--------------------------
Examples of LIBOR - Based Products and Transactions . Both Paul and Peter can enter into a swap agreement , exchanging their respective interest receipts . Paul will receive the fixed 1.5 % interest over his $ 1 million investment from Peter which equals $ 15,000 , while Peter receives LIBOR + 1 % variable interest from Paul .
--------------------------
Examples of LIBOR - Based Products and Transactions . If LIBOR is 1 % , then Peter will receive 2 % or $ 20,000 from Paul . Since this figure is higher than what he owes to Paul , in net terms Peter will get $ 5,000 ( $ 20,000 - $ 15,000 ) from Paul . By next quarter , if LIBOR comes down to 0.25 % , Peter will be eligible to receive 1.25 % or $ 12,500 from Paul . In net terms , Paul will get $ 2,500 ( $ 15,000 - $ 12,500 ) from Peter .
--------------------------
Examples of LIBOR - Based Products and Transactions . Such swaps essentially fulfill the requirement of both the transacting parties who wanted to change the type of interest receipts ( fixed and floating ) .
