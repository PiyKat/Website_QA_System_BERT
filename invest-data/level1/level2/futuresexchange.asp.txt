What Is a Futures Exchange ? . A futures exchange is a diverse marketplace where commodities futures , index futures , and options on futures contracts are bought and sold . Those who are allowed access to the exchange are brokers and commercial traders who are members of the exchange . Members need to be registered with the National Futures Association ( NFA ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) . Individuals who want to trade futures contracts must do so by having an account with a registered broker . Futures exchanges also provide clearing and settlement functions .
--------------------------
How a Futures Exchange Works . The function of a futures exchange is to standardize and promote futures trading for as many participants as possible . The incentive mechanisms for those who run the exchange are roughly based on the volume and dollar value of what is traded â€” the more the better . That means they work to bring in as many participants making as many trades as is possible . This has led to many innovations in recent years , driving increased participation through electronic networks .
--------------------------
How a Futures Exchange Works . Where a futures exchange used to have an important physical presence , such as the trading floors in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) or the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) , it is no longer true that these locations hold as much meaning as they once did . Since trading can happen from the computer of anyone connected through the internet to an exchange - member broker , trading is decentralized around the world and happens nearly 24 hours a day during the week .
--------------------------
How a Futures Exchange Works . Futures traded on a futures exchange allow the sellers of the underlying commodities the certainty on the price they will receive for their products at the market . At the same time , the exchange will enable consumers or buyers of those underlying commodities the certainty of the price they will pay , at a defined time in the future .
--------------------------
How a Futures Exchange Works . To encourage as much participation and liquidity as possible , contracts trading on an exchange have standardized sizes , expiration dates , and , for options , strike prices . This standardization contrasts to over - the - counter ( OTC ) contracts where buyers and sellers agree to bespoke terms .
--------------------------
How a Futures Exchange Works . Exchanges also provide pricing information , disseminated by information vendor firms . Information sharing allows for transparency in activities and fairness to all . Pricing information , including price , bids , and offers , is available to all interested institutions and individuals equally , no matter their size .
--------------------------
How a Futures Exchange Works . Another very important aspect of the exchange is that it provides clearing services . While various firms provide the clearing , the exchange standardizes the charges and the performance of that service . Clearing services insure that participants do n't have to worry about the risk of their trade counterparty failing to deliver on their contractual obligations . That makes trading a very simple proposition for short - term speculators and keeps them interested in participating in the futures market .

A Short History of Futures Exchanges in the U.S. . The largest futures exchange in the U.S. , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , was formed in the late 1890s when the only futures contracts offered were for agricultural products . The emergence of interest rate , or bond futures , and currency futures in major foreign exchange markets came in the 1970s . Today 's futures exchanges are significantly larger , with hedging of financial instruments via futures . These futures hedging contracts comprise the majority of the futures market activity . Futures exchanges play an important role in the operation of the global financial system .
