What Is Benchmark Error ? . Benchmark error is a situation in which the wrong benchmark is selected in a financial model , causing the model to produce inaccurate results .
--------------------------
What Is Benchmark Error ? . This type of error can be easily avoided by selecting the most appropriate benchmark possible when configuring the model . Although benchmark error is sometimes confused with tracking error , the two terms have distinct meanings .
--------------------------
Understanding Benchmark Error . A benchmark , also called an index or proxy , is a standard against which the performance of a security , investment strategy , or investment manager can be measured . It is therefore important to select a benchmark that has a similar risk - return profile of the security , strategy , or manager in question . Otherwise , the analysis could produce conclusions that are misleading and unreliable .
--------------------------
Understanding Benchmark Error . Today , investors have thousands of benchmarks to choose from . These include not only traditional equity and fixed income benchmarks , but also more exotic benchmarks created for hedge funds , derivatives , real estate , and other types of investments .
--------------------------
Understanding Benchmark Error . The choice of an appropriate benchmark is important to investors and investment managers alike . Investors and managers keep a close eye on their investment portfolios and their benchmarks to see if their portfolio is performing in line with their expectations . If the portfolio â€™s performance deviates significantly from the benchmark chosen , it may indicate that style drift has occurred . In other words , it might indicate that the portfolio has drifted away from its desired risk tolerance and investment style .
--------------------------
. Examples of factors considered when selecting an appropriate benchmark include the region , industry , volatility , market capitalization , and liquidity of the securities in question .
--------------------------
Real World Example of Benchmark Error . Alison is constructing a portfolio of American technology stocks using the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . When considering what benchmark to use , she rejects using the Japanese Nikkei index as her benchmark because she determines that it is an inappropriate comparison for American stocks and would therefore introduce benchmark error .
--------------------------
Real World Example of Benchmark Error . Instead of the Nikkei index , Alison decides to use the Nasdaq index as her benchmark , which represents prominent American technology companies that are similar to the companies she intends to include in her portfolio .
