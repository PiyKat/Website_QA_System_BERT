What is a Monte Carlo Simulation ? . Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that can not easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables . It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models .
--------------------------
What is a Monte Carlo Simulation ? . Monte Carlo simulation can be used to tackle a range of problems in virtually every field such as finance , engineering , supply chain , and science .

What is a Monte Carlo Simulation ? . Monte Carlo simulation is also referred to as multiple probability simulation .
--------------------------
Explaining Monte Carlo Simulations . When faced with significant uncertainty in the process of making a forecast or estimation , rather than just replacing the uncertain variable with a single average number , the Monte Carlo Simulation might prove to be a better solution . Since business and finance are plagued by random variables , Monte Carlo simulations have a vast array of potential applications in these fields . They are used to estimate the probability of cost overruns in large projects and the likelihood that an asset price will move in a certain way . Telecoms use them to assess network performance in different scenarios , helping them to optimize the network . Analysts use them to assess the risk that an entity will default and to analyze derivatives such as options . Insurers and oil well drillers also use them . Monte Carlo simulations have countless applications outside of business and finance , such as in meteorology , astronomy and particle physics .
--------------------------
Explaining Monte Carlo Simulations . Monte Carlo simulations are named after the gambling hot spot in Monaco , since chance and random outcomes are central to the modeling technique , much as they are to games like roulette , dice , and slot machines . The technique was first developed by Stanislaw Ulam , a mathematician who worked on the Manhattan Project . After the war , while recovering from brain surgery , Ulam entertained himself by playing countless games of solitaire . He became interested in plotting the outcome of each of these games in order to observe their distribution and determine the probability of winning . After he shared his idea with John Von Neumann , the two collaborated to develop the Monte Carlo simulation .

Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . One way to employ a Monte Carlo simulation is to model possible movements of asset prices using Excel or a similar program . There are two components to an asset 's price movements : drift , which is a constant directional movement , and a random input , which represents market volatility . By analyzing historical price data , you can determine the drift , standard deviation , variance , and average price movement for a security . These are the building blocks of a Monte Carlo simulation .
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . To project one possible price trajectory , use the historical price data of the asset to generate a series of periodic daily returns using the natural logarithm ( note that this equation differs from the usual percentage change formula ) :
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . ﻿Periodic Daily Return = ln(Day ’s PricePrevious Day ’s Price)\begin{aligned } & \text{Periodic Daily Return } = ln \left ( \frac { \text{Day 's Price } } { \text{Previous Day 's Price } } \right ) \\ \end{aligned}​Periodic Daily Return = ln(Previous Day ’s PriceDay ’s Price​)​﻿
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . Next use the AVERAGE , STDEV.P , and VAR.P functions on the entire resulting series to obtain the average daily return , standard deviation , and variance inputs , respectively . The drift is equal to :
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . ﻿Drift = Average Daily Return−Variance2where : Average Daily Return = Produced from Excel’sAVERAGE function from periodic daily returns seriesVariance = Produced from Excel’sVAR.P function from periodic daily returns series\begin{aligned } & \text{Drift } = \text{Average Daily Return } - \frac { \text{Variance } } { 2 } \\ & \textbf{where : } \\ & \text{Average Daily Return } = \text{Produced from Excel 's } \\ & \text{AVERAGE function from periodic daily returns series } \\ & \text{Variance } = \text{Produced from Excel 's } \\ & \text{VAR.P function from periodic daily returns series } \\ \end{aligned}​Drift = Average Daily Return−2Variance​where : Average Daily Return = Produced from Excel’sAVERAGE function from periodic daily returns seriesVariance = Produced from Excel’sVAR.P function from periodic daily returns series​﻿
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . Alternatively , drift can be set to 0 ; this choice reflects a certain theoretical orientation , but the difference will not be huge , at least for shorter time frames .
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . Next obtain a random input :
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . ﻿Random Value = σ×NORMSINV(RAND())where : σ = Standard deviation , produced from Excel’sSTDEV.P function from periodic daily returns seriesNORMSINV and RAND = Excel functions\begin{aligned } & \text{Random Value } = \sigma \times \text{NORMSINV(RAND ( ) ) } \\ & \textbf{where : } \\ & \sigma = \text{Standard deviation , produced from Excel 's } \\ & \text{STDEV.P function from periodic daily returns series } \\ & \text{NORMSINV and RAND } = \text{Excel functions } \\ \end{aligned}​Random Value = σ×NORMSINV(RAND())where : σ = Standard deviation , produced from Excel’sSTDEV.P function from periodic daily returns seriesNORMSINV and RAND = Excel functions​﻿
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . The equation for the following day 's price is :
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . ﻿Next Day ’s Price = Today ’s Price×e(Drift+Random Value)\begin{aligned } & \text{Next Day 's Price } = \text{Today 's Price } \times e^ { ( \text{Drift } + \text{Random Value } ) } \\ \end{aligned}​Next Day ’s Price = Today ’s Price×e(Drift+Random Value)​﻿
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . To take e to a given power x in Excel , use the EXP function : EXP(x ) . Repeat this calculation the desired number of times ( each repetition represents one day ) to obtain a simulation of future price movement . By generating an arbitrary number of simulations , you can assess the probability that a security 's price will follow given trajectory . Here is an example , showing around 30 projections for the Time Warner Inc 's ( TWX ) stock for the remainder of November 2015 :
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . The frequencies of different outcomes generated by this simulation will form a normal distribution , that is , a bell curve . The most likely return is at the middle of the curve , meaning there is an equal chance that the actual return will be higher or lower than that value . The probability that the actual return will be within one standard deviation of the most probable ( " expected " ) rate is 68 % ; that it will be within two standard deviations is 95 % ; and that it will be within three standard deviations is 99.7 % . Still , there is no guarantee that the most expected outcome will occur , or that actual movements will not exceed the wildest projections .
--------------------------
Example of Monte Carlo Simulations : The Asset Price Modeling . Crucially , Monte Carlo simulations ignore everything that is not built into the price movement ( macro trends , company leadership , hype , cyclical factors ) ; in other words , they assume perfectly efficient markets . For example , the fact that Time Warner lowered its guidance for the year on November 4 is not reflected here , except in the price movement for that day , the last value in the data ; if that fact were accounted for , the bulk of simulations would probably not predict a modest rise in price .
