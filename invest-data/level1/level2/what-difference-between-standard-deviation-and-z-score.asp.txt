Z - Score and Standard Deviation : An Overview . Although the finance industry can be complex , an understanding of the calculation and interpretation of basic mathematical building blocks is still the foundation for success , whether in accounting , economics or investing .
--------------------------
Z - Score and Standard Deviation : An Overview . Standard deviation and Z - score are two such fundamentals . Z - scores can help traders gauge the volatility of securities . The score shows how far away from the mean — either above or below — a value is situated . Standard deviation is a statical measure that shows how elements are dispersed around the average , or mean . Standard deviation helps to indicate how a particular investment will perform , so , it is a predictive calculation .

Z - Score and Standard Deviation : An Overview . In finance , the Z - score helps to predict the probability of an entity filing for bankruptcy and is known as the Altman Z - score .

Z - Score and Standard Deviation : An Overview . A firm grasp of how to calculate and utilize these two measurements enables a more thorough analysis of patterns and changes in any data set , from business expenditures to stock prices .
--------------------------
Z - Score . The Z - score , or standard score , is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies above or below the mean . The mean is the average of all values in a group , added together , and then divided by the total number of items in the group .
--------------------------
Z - Score . To calculate Z - score , subtract the mean from each of the individual data points and divide the result by the standard deviation . Results of zero show the point and the mean equal . A result of one indicates the point is one standard deviation above the mean and when data points are below the mean , the Z - score is negative .
--------------------------
Z - Score . In most large data sets , 99 % of values have a Z - score between -3 and 3 , meaning they lie within three standard deviations above or below the mean .
--------------------------
Z - Score . Z - scores offer analysts a way to compare data against a norm . A given company ’s financial information is more meaningful when you know how it compares to that of other , comparable companies . Z - score results of zero indicate that the data point being analyzed is exactly average , situated among the norm . A score of 1 indicates that the data are one standard deviation from the mean , while a Z - score of -1 places the data one standard deviation below the mean . The higher the Z - score , the further from the norm the data can be considered the be .
--------------------------
Z - Score . In investing , when the Z - score is higher it indicates that the expected returns will be volatile , or are likely to be different from what is expected .
--------------------------
Z - Score . Bollinger Bands ® is a technical indicator used by traders and analysts to assess market volatility based on standard deviation . Simply put , they are a visual representation of the Z - score . For any given price , the number of standard deviations from the mean is reflected by the number of Bollinger Bands between the price and the exponential moving average ( EMA ) .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is essentially a reflection of the amount of variability within a given data set . It shows the extent to which the individual data points in a data set vary from the mean . In investing , a large standard deviation means that more of your data points deviate from the norm , so , the investment will either outperform or underperform similar securities . A small standard deviation means that more of your data points are clustered near the norm and returns will be closer to the expected results .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation . Investors expect a benchmark index fund to have a low standard deviation . However , with growth funds , the deviation should be higher as the management will make aggressive moves to capture returns . As with other investments , higher returns equate to higher investment risks .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation . The standard deviation can be visualized as a bell curve , with a flatter , more spread - out bell curve representing a large standard deviation and a steep , tall bell curve representing a small standard deviation .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation . To calculate standard deviation , first , calculate the difference between each data point and the mean . The differences are then squared , summed and averaged to produce the variance . The standard deviation , then , is the square root of the variance , which brings it back to the original unit of measure .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation . In investing , standard deviation and Z - score can be useful tools in determining market volatility . As the standard deviation increases , it indicates that price action varies widely within the established time frame . Given this information , the Z - score of a particular price indicates how typical or atypical this movement is based on previous performance .
