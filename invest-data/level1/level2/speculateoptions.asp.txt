How Do Speculators Profit From Options ? . As a quick summary , options are financial derivatives that give their holders the right to buy or sell a specific asset by a specific time at a given price ( strike price ) . There are two types of options : calls and puts . Call options refer to options that enable the option holder to buy an asset whereas put options enable the holder to sell an asset .

How Do Speculators Profit From Options ? . Speculation , by definition , requires a trader to take a position in a market , where he is anticipating whether the price of a security or asset will increase or decrease . Speculators try to profit big , and one way to do this is by using derivatives that use large amounts of leverage . This is where options come into play .
--------------------------
Options in Operation . Options provide a source of leverage because they can be quite a bit cheaper to purchase in comparison to the actual stock . This allows a trader to control a larger position in options , compared with owning the underlying stock . For example , suppose a trader has $ 2,000 to invest , and an XYZ stock costs $ 50 and an XYZ call option ( with a strike price of $ 50 that expires in six months ) costs $ 2 each . If the trader only buys stock , then he will have a position with 40 shares ( $ 2,000/$50 ) . But if he takes a position with only options ( $ 2,000/$2 ) , he effectively controls a position of 1,000 shares . In these cases , all gains and losses will be magnified by the usage of the options . In this example , if the XYZ stock drops to $ 49 in six months , in the all stock scenario , the trader 's position is $ 1,960 , whereas in the all option situation his total value will be $ 0 . All the options would be worthless then , because no one would exercise the option to buy at a price that is greater than the current market value .
--------------------------
Options in Operation . The speculator 's anticipation on the asset 's situation will determine what sort of options strategy that he or she will take . If the speculator believes that an asset will increase in value , he or she should purchase call options that have a strike price that is lower than the anticipated price level . In the event that the speculator 's belief is correct and the asset 's price does indeed go up substantially , the speculator will be able to close out his or her position and realize the gain ( by selling the call option for the price that will be equal to the difference between the strike price and the market value ) .
--------------------------
Options in Operation . On the other hand , if the speculator believes that an asset will fall in value , he or she can purchase put options with a strike price that is higher than the anticipated price level . If the price of the asset does fall below the put option 's strike price , the speculator can sell the put options for a price that is equal to the difference between the strike price and the market price in order to realize any applicable gains .
