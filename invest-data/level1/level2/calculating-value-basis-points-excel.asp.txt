Calculating the Dollar Value of Basis Points in Excel . In the fixed income market , each instrument 's smallest increment of movement is called a tick . Each variation can not be lower than a tick , and it is determined according to the value of the instrument traded . For the market rate , the minimum unit is the basis point . If a rate goes from 2 to 2.1 % , the rate will be increased by 10 basis points . The basis point corresponds to one - hundredth of 1 % , or 0.01 % .
--------------------------
Calculating the Dollar Value of Basis Points in Excel . This term is frequently used in the monetary policy rate sector , where one does not speak of a percentage variation but basis points . Thus a rise in the interest rate from 1.3 % to 1.35 % does not increase by 3.84 % , but by five basis points . It is common to hear media commentators state that such an increase corresponds to an increase of 0.05 % . However , this is not the case ; the increase is , in fact , five basis points up to 3.84 % .
--------------------------
Basis Points and Interest Rates . Often interest rates change from 25 to 50 basis points . But even an increase of a few basis points on an interest rate may result in an overall increase of all levels , whether in credit markets or real estate markets . The largest market moves , such as those between 100 and 200 points , are rare and often signal an impetus to fundamentally change the monetary policy of the country or correct a deteriorating economic environment . For example , a central bank , by changing its rates , can significantly impact the economy of a country . Thus , rising interest rates can slow growth but also inflation .

Basis Points and Interest Rates . Conversely , a sharp drop in interest rates will result in a boom in the economy because money is cheaper to obtain .

Basis Points , Interest Rates and Borrowing . Borrowing rates for individuals closely follow bank - lending rates , which in turn reflect rates set by central banks . Here 's how . Often banks borrow from each other the money that they lend out to clients . The interbank rate is the rate of interest charged on short - term loans made between institutions .

Basis Points , Interest Rates and Borrowing . These short - term loans are of one week or less . Some , made to meet reserve requirements , are just for one day — literally overnight — and these loans are made at a rate known as the overnight rate or ( in the U.S. ) the federal funds rate .
--------------------------
Basis Points , Interest Rates and Borrowing . The fed funds rate , as it 's colloquially known , is one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy . Lenders derive their prime interest rate , the rate they charge their most creditworthy borrowers , from it . The terms for other consumer loans or investment instruments , like CDs , are then based on this prime rate : You 've probably seen an interest rate advertised as " prime plus 3 % ! " or " two points above prime ! " So the fed funds rate ends up influencing short - term interest rates for everything from home and auto loans to credit cards ' APRs . Longer - term rates reflect it too , albeit indirectly .

Calculating the Dollar Value of a Basis Point . Calculating the dollar value of basis points is a straightforward procedure in Excel .
--------------------------
Calculating the Dollar Value of a Basis Point . As an example , say we have a one - year loan of $ 1,000,000 . Let ’s calculate the value of a 1.5 basis - point change on an annual , quarterly or monthly basis . We would simply prorate the value of the change in basis by four if for a quarter period , and by 12 on a monthly time span .
--------------------------
Calculating the Dollar Value of a Basis Point . We multiply the value of the instrument we wish to compute the by the change in basis points . Here we multiply C9 by C11 and divide by 10,000 . 10,000 corresponds to 0.01 of 1 % . 0.01 * 0.01=0.0001 . The " VLOOKUP " takes care of the prorating on a quarterly or monthly basis .
--------------------------
Calculating the Dollar Value of a Basis Point . Here we see that the value of 1.5 basis points on $ 1,000,000 prorated to a monthly basis corresponds to $ 12.50 .
