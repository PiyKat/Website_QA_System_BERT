How Long Will It Take for a Savings Bond to Reach Its Face Value ? . The time it takes a savings bond to reach face value depends on the series of bond and the value at which it was sold . There are three different series of bonds . Series EE and I are intended to be savings bonds , and Series HH is intended to be an investment bond .
--------------------------
Series EE Bonds . Series EE bonds mature after 30 years , meaning they can earn interest for that period of time . EE bonds are sold for half of the face value , and the U.S. Treasury Department guarantees that they will reach face value after 20 years . If the interest payments do n't cause the bond to reach full face value at the end of 20 years , the government will do a one - time adjustment to bring the bond 's value to equal face value .
--------------------------
Series EE Bonds . It 's important to keep in mind , however , that EE bonds must be owned for at least one year before redemption . If they are redeemed before five years , the last three months ' worth of interest is forfeited , but after five years , they can be redeemed with no penalty . The annual interest rate for EE bonds issued from November 1 , 2018 , to April 30 , 2019 , is 0.10 % .
--------------------------
Series I Bonds . Series I bonds are sold at face value and mature after 30 years . Redemption rules are the same with Series I bonds as Series EE bonds . The composite rate for Series I bonds issued from November 1 , 2018 , through April 30 , 2019 , is 2.83 % . This rate applies for the first six months that you own the bond .
--------------------------
Series HH Bonds . Series HH bonds are also sold at face value , with bondholders receiving interest payments through direct deposit every six months for the 20-year life of the bond . As of January 2003 , HH bonds have earned an interest rate of 1.5 % . HH bonds have not been available for purchase since September 1 , 2004 , but bondholders will continue to receive interest payments until the bonds ' maturity .
