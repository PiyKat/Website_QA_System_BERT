What Does Fair Market Value Mean ? . In its simplest sense , fair market value ( FMV ) is the price that property would sell for on the open market . A term commonly used in tax and real estate , fair market value has come to represent the price of an asset under the following usual set of conditions : Prospective buyers and sellers are reasonably knowledgeable about the asset , behaving in their own best interests , free of undue pressure to trade and given a reasonable time period for completing the transaction . Given these conditions , an asset 's fair market value should represent an accurate valuation or assessment of its worth .
--------------------------
Understanding Fair Market Value ( FMV ) . The term fair market value is intentionally distinct from similar terms such as market value or appraised value because it considers the economic principles of free and open market activity , whereas the term market value simply refers to the price of an asset in the marketplace . Therefore , while a home 's market value can easily be found on a listing , the fair market value is more difficult to determine . Similarly , the term appraised value refers to an asset 's value in the opinion of a single appraiser , thus not immediately qualifying the appraisal as a fair market value . In cases where a fair market value is needed , however , an appraisal will usually suffice .

Understanding Fair Market Value ( FMV ) . Due to the thorough considerations made by the term fair market value , it 's often used in legal settings . For example , the fair market value of real estate is commonly used in divorce settlements and to calculate compensation related to the government 's use of eminent domain . Fair market values are also often utilized in taxation , such as when determining the fair market value of property for a tax deduction after a casualty loss .

Practical Uses of Fair Market Value . Municipal property taxes are often assessed based on the FMV of the owner 's property . Depending on how long the owner has owned the home , the difference between the purchase price and the residence 's FMV can be substantial . Professional appraisers use standards , guidelines , and national and local regulations to determine a home 's FMV .

Practical Uses of Fair Market Value . FMV is also often used in the insurance industry . For example , when an insurance claim is made as a result of a car accident , the insurance company covering the damage to the owner 's vehicle usually covers damages up to the vehicle 's FMV .
--------------------------
FMV and Taxation . Worldwide tax authorities are always ensuring that transactions , especially those made between people not dealing at arm 's length , are realized at FMV , at least for tax purposes . For example , a father who is retiring may sell the shares of his business to his daughter for $ 1 so that she can carry on as the owner of the family business . However , if the FMV of the shares is higher , tax authorities such as the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) may well recharacterize the transaction for tax purposes , and the father will need to pay taxes on the disposition of the shares as though he had sold them at FMV to a third party .
--------------------------
FMV and Taxation . Another field of taxation where FMV regularly comes into play is the donation of property , such as artwork , to charities . In these cases , the donor usually receives a tax credit for the value of the donation . Tax authorities need to ensure that the credit given is for the true FMV of the object and often ask donors to provide independent valuations for their donations .
