What Is a Subprime Mortgage ? . A subprime mortgage is one that 's normally issued to borrowers with low credit ratings . A prime conventional mortgage is n't offered because the lender views the borrower as having a greater - than - average risk of defaulting on the loan .
--------------------------
What Is a Subprime Mortgage ? . Lending institutions often charge interest on subprime mortgages at a much higher rate than on prime mortgages to compensate for carrying more risk . These are often adjustable rate mortgages ( ARMs ) as well , so the interest rate can potentially increase at specified points in time .
--------------------------
. Lenders are n't legally obligated to offer you the best available mortgage terms or even let you know that they 're available , so consider applying for a prime mortgage first to find out if you do indeed qualify .
--------------------------
Understanding Subprime Mortgages . " Subprime " does n't refer to the interest rates often attached to these mortgages , but rather the credit score of the individual taking out the mortgage . Borrowers with FICO credit scores below 600 will often be stuck with subprime mortgages and their corresponding higher interest rates . It can be useful for people with low credit scores to wait for a period of time and build up their credit histories before applying for a mortgage so they might qualify for a prime loan .
--------------------------
Understanding Subprime Mortgages . The interest rate associated with a subprime mortgage is dependent on four factors : credit score , the size of the down payment , the number of late payment delinquencies on a borrower 's credit report , and the types of the delinquencies found on the report .
--------------------------
Subprime Mortgages vs. Prime Mortgages . Mortgage applicants are typically graded from A to F , with A scores going to those with exemplary credit and F scores going to those with no discernible ability to repay a loan at all . Prime mortgages go to A and B candidates , whereas C , D and F candidates must typically resign themselves to subprime loans if they 're going to get loans at all .
--------------------------
An Example of the Effect of Subprime Mortgages . The 2008 housing market crash was due in large part to widespread defaults on subprime mortgages . Many borrowers were given what were known as NINJA loans ( No Income No Job No Assets ) .
--------------------------
An Example of the Effect of Subprime Mortgages . These mortgages were often issued with no down payment required , and proof of income was not necessary , either . A buyer might state that she earned $ 150,000 a year but did not have to provide documentation to substantiate her claim . These borrowers then found themselves underwater in a declining housing market with their home values lower than the mortgage they owed . Many of these NINJA borrowers defaulted because the interest rates associated with the loans were " teaser rates , " variable rates that started low and ballooned over time , making it very hard to pay down the principle of the mortgage .
--------------------------
An Example of the Effect of Subprime Mortgages . Wells Fargo , Bank of America , and other financial institutions reported in June 2015 that they would begin offering mortgages to individuals with credit ratings in the low 600s , and the non - profit , community advocacy and homeownership organization Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America launched an initiative in late 2018 , hosting events nationwide to help people apply for " non - prime " loans , which are effectively the same as subprime mortgages .
