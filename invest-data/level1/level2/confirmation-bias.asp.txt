What Is Confirmation Bias ? . Confirmation bias is a term from the field of cognitive psychology that describes how people naturally favor information that confirms their previously existing beliefs .
--------------------------
What Is Confirmation Bias ? . Experts in the field of behavioral finance identify that this fundamental principle applies to investors in notable ways . Because investors seek out information that confirms their existing opinions and ignore contrary information that refutes them , they may skew the value of their investing decisions based on their own cognitive biases . This psychological phenomenon occurs when investors filter out potentially useful facts and opinions that do n’t coincide with their preconceived notions .
--------------------------
Understanding Confirmation Bias . Confirmation bias can create problems for investors . When researching an investment , someone might inadvertently look for information that supports his or her beliefs about the investment and fail to see the information that presents different ideas . The result is a one - sided view of the situation . Confirmation bias can thus cause investors to make poor decisions , whether it ’s in their choice of investments or their buy - and - sell timing .
--------------------------
Understanding Confirmation Bias . Confirmation bias affects perceptions and decision making in all aspects of life and can cause investors to make less - than - optimal choices . Seeking out people and publications with alternative opinions can help overcome confirmation bias and assist in making better - informed decisions .
--------------------------
Understanding Confirmation Bias . This phenomenon is a source of investor overconfidence and helps explain why the bulls tend to remain bullish , and the bears tend to remain bearish regardless of what is happening in the market . Confirmation bias helps explain why investors do not always behave rationally and perhaps supports arguments that the market behaves inefficiently .
--------------------------
Example of Confirmation Bias . Suppose an investor hears a rumor that a company is on the verge of declaring bankruptcy . Based on this information , the investor considers selling the stock . When they go online to read the latest news about the company , they read only the stories that confirm the likely bankruptcy scenario and miss a story about a new product the company has just launched that is expected to perform well and increase sales . Instead of holding the stock , the investor sells it at a substantial loss just before it turns around and climbs to an all - time high .
--------------------------
Overcoming Confirmation Bias . Seek Contrary Advice : The first step to overcoming confirmation bias is to have an awareness that it exists . Once an investor has gathered information that supports their opinions and beliefs about a particular investment , they should seek alternative ideas that challenge their point of view . It is good practice to make a list of the investment ’s pros and cons and reassess it with an open mind .
--------------------------
Overcoming Confirmation Bias . Avoid Confirming Questions : Investors should not ask questions that confirm their conclusions about an investment . For example , an investor who wants to buy a stock because it has a low price - earnings ( P / E ) ratio would be confirming their findings if they only asked their financial advisor about the company ’s valuation . A better approach would be to ask the broker for more information about the stock , which can be pieced together to form an unbiased conclusion .
