How Do You Calculate Value at Risk ( VaR ) in Excel ? . Value at Risk ( VaR ) is one of the most widely known measurements for risk assessment and risk management . The goal of risk management is to identify and understand exposures to risk , to measure that risk , and then apply the knowledge to address those risks .
--------------------------
Value at Risk ( VaR ) Explained . The VaR measurement shows a normal distribution of past losses . The measure is often applied to an investment portfolio for which the calculation gives a confidence interval about the likelihood of exceeding a certain loss threshold . That data is used by investors to make decisions and set strategy . Stated simply , the VaR is a probability - based estimate of the minimum loss in dollar terms expected over a period .
--------------------------
Pros and Cons of Value at Risk ( VaR ) . There are a few pros and some significant cons to using VaR in risk measurement . On the plus side , the measurement is widely used by financial industry professionals and , as a measure , it is easy to understand . The VaR offers clarity . For example , a VaR assessment might lead to the following statement : " We are 99 % confident our losses will not exceed $ 5 million in a trading day . "
--------------------------
Pros and Cons of Value at Risk ( VaR ) . Regarding the drawbacks to VaR , the most critical is that the 99 % confidence in the above example is the minimum dollar figure . For the 1 % of occasions where our minimum loss does exceed that figure , there is no indication of how much . The loss could be $ 100 million or many orders of magnitude greater than the VaR threshold . Surprisingly , the model is designed to work this way because the probabilities in VaR are based on a normal distribution of returns . But financial markets are known to have non - normal distributions . Financial markets have extreme outlier events on a regular basis — far more than a normal distribution would predict . Finally , the VaR calculation requires several statistical measurements such as variance , covariance , and standard deviation . With a two - asset portfolio , this is relatively straightforward . However , the complexity increases exponentially for a highly diversified portfolio .

What Is the Formula for VaR ? . VaR is defined as :
--------------------------
What Is the Formula for VaR ? . ﻿VaR=[Expected Weighted Return of the Portfolio− ( z - score of the confidence interval× standard deviation of the portfolio)]× portfolio value\begin{aligned}VaR & = [ \text{Expected\ Weighted\ Return\ of\ the\ Portfolio}\\&\quad -\ ( z\text{-score\ of\ the\ confidence\ interval}\\&\quad\times\ \text{standard\ deviation\ of\ the\ portfolio)]}\\&\quad\times\ \text{portfolio\ value}\\\end{aligned}VaR​=[Expected Weighted Return of the Portfolio− ( z - score of the confidence interval× standard deviation of the portfolio)]× portfolio value​﻿
--------------------------
What Is the Formula for VaR ? . Typically , a timeframe is expressed in years . However , if the timeframe is being measured in weeks or days , we divide the expected return by the interval and the standard deviation by the square root of the interval . For example , if the timeframe is weekly , the respective inputs would be adjusted to ( expected return ÷ 52 ) and ( portfolio standard deviation ÷ √52 ) . If daily , use 252 and √252 , respectively .
--------------------------
What Is the Formula for VaR ? . As with many financial applications , the formula sounds easy — it has only a few inputs — but calculating the inputs for a large portfolio is computationally intense . You must estimate the expected return for the portfolio , which can be error - prone , calculate the portfolio correlations and variance , and then plug in all the data . In other words , it is not as easy as it looks .
