How do you calculate the debt - to - equity ratio ? . The debt - to - equity ratio shows the proportions of equity and debt a company is using to finance its assets and it signals the extent to which shareholder 's equity can fulfill obligations to creditors , in the event a business declines .
--------------------------
How do you calculate the debt - to - equity ratio ? . A low debt - to - equity ratio indicates a lower amount of financing by debt via lenders , versus funding through equity via shareholders . A higher ratio indicates that the company is getting more of its financing by borrowing money , which subjects the company to potential risk if debt levels are too high . Simply put : the more a company 's operations rely on borrowed money , the greater the risk of bankruptcy , if the business hits hard times . This is because minimum payments on loans must still be paid -- even if a company has not profited enough to meet its obligations . For a highly leveraged company , sustained earnings declines could lead to financial distress or bankruptcy .
--------------------------
How to Calculate Debt - to - Equity : . To calculate debt - to - equity , divide a company 's total liabilities by its total amount of shareholders ' equity as shown below .
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . Apple Inc. ( AAPL )
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . We can see below that for the fiscal year ending of 2017 , Apple had total liabilities of $ 241 billion ( rounded ) and total shareholders ' equity of $ 134 billion , according to their 10 K statement .
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . Using the above formula , the debt - to - equity ratio for AAPL can be calculated as :
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . Debt - to - equity = $ 241,000,000 รท $ 134,000,000 = 1.80
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . The result means that Apple had $ 1.80 of debt for every dollar of equity . But on its own , the ratio does n't give investors the complete picture . It 's important to compare the ratio to other similar companies . For example , for the end of 2017 , General Motors had a debt - to - equity ratio of 5.03 - -far higher than Apple 's . However , the two companies are players in different industries . And given the capital expenditures needed to operate manufacturing plants around the world , it makes sense that GM has a higher ratio since it 's likely to have more liabilities . Comparing the ratios to company 's within their industries presents a clearer picture of how the companies are performing .
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . Debt - to - equity for the fiscal year ending 2017 :
--------------------------
Example of Debt - to - Equity . We can see above that GM 's debt - to - equity ratio of 5.03 , compared to Ford 's 6.37 , is not as high as it was when compared to Apple 's 1.80 debt - to - equity ratio . However , when comparing Apple to technology companies like Netflix and Amazon , it becomes apparent that Apple uses far less debt financing than those two companies . Of course , that 's not to say that the debt - to - equity ratios for Amazon and Netflix are too high , however , that number may inspire investors to take a peek at the companies ' balance sheets , to determine how they are using their debt to drive earnings .
--------------------------
Bottom Line . The debt - to - equity ratio can help investors identify highly leveraged companies that may pose risks , during rough patches . Investors can compare a company 's debt - to - equity ratio against industry averages and other similar companies to gain a general indication of a company 's equity - liability relationship . But not all high debt - to - equity ratios signal poor business practices . In fact , debt can catalyze the expansion of a company 's operations and ultimately generate additional income for both the business and its shareholders .
