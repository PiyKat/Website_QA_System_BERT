What Is an Investor ? . An investor is any person or other entity ( such as a firm or mutual fund ) who commits capital with the expectation of receiving financial returns . Investors utilize investments in order to grow their money and/or provide an income during retirement , such as with an annuity .
--------------------------
What Is an Investor ? . A wide variety of investment vehicles exist including ( but not limited to ) stocks , bonds , commodities , mutual funds , exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , options , futures , foreign exchange , gold , silver , retirement plans and real estate . Investors typically perform technical and/or fundamental analysis to determine favorable investment opportunities , and generally prefer to minimize risk while maximizing returns .
--------------------------
What Is an Investor ? . An investor typically is made distinct from a trader . An investor puts capital to use for long - term gain , while a trader seeks to generate short - term profits by buying and selling securities over and over again .
--------------------------
What Is an Investor ? . Investors typically generate returns by deploying capital as either equity or debt investments . Equity investments entail ownership stakes in the form of company stock that may pay dividends in addition to capital gains . Debt investments may be as loans extended to other individuals or firms , or in the form of purchasing bonds issued by governments or corporations which pay interest in the form of coupons .
--------------------------
How Investors Work . Investors are not a uniform bunch . They have varying risk tolerances , capital , styles , preferences and time frames . For instance , some investors may prefer very low - risk investments that will lead to conservative gains , such as certificates of deposits and certain bond products . Other investors , however , are more inclined to take on additional risk in an attempt to make a larger profit . These investors might invest in currencies , emerging markets or stocks , all while dealing with a roller coaster of different factors on a daily basis .
--------------------------
How Investors Work . A distinction can be made between the terms " investor " and " trader " in that investors typically hold positions for years to decades ( also called a " position trader " or " buy and hold investor " ) while traders generally hold positions for shorter periods . Scalp traders , for example , hold positions for as little as a few seconds . Swing traders , on the other hand , seek positions that are held from several days to several weeks .
--------------------------
How Investors Work . Institutional investors are organizations such as financial firms or mutual funds that invest in stocks and other financial instruments and build sizable portfolios . Often , they are able to accumulate and pool money from several smaller investors ( individuals and/or firms ) in order to take larger investments . Because of this , institutional investors often have far greater market power and influence than individual retail investors .
--------------------------
Passive and Active Investors . Investors may also adopt various market strategies . Passive investors tend to buy and hold various market indexes , and may optimize their allocation weights to certain asset classes based on rules such as Modern Portfolio Theory 's ( MPT ) mean - variance optimization . Others may be stock pickers who invest based on fundamental analysis of corporate financial statements and financial ratios .
--------------------------
Passive and Active Investors . One example of this would be the " value " investors who seek to purchase stocks with low share prices relative to their book value . Others may seek to invest long - term in " growth " stocks that may be losing money at the moment but are growing rapidly and hold promise for the future ,
--------------------------
Passive and Active Investors . Passive ( indexed ) investing is becoming increasingly popular , where it is expected to overtake active investment strategies as the dominant stock market logic by the year 2020 . The growth of low - cost target - date mutual funds , ETFs and robo - advisors are responsible for this surge in popularity .
