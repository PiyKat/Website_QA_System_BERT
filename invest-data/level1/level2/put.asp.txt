What Is a Put ? . A put is an options contract that gives the owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a certain amount of the underlying asset , at a set price within a specific time . The buyer of a put option believes that the underlying stock will drop below the exercise price before the expiration date . The exercise price is the price that the underlying asset must reach for the put option contract to hold value .
--------------------------
The Basics of Put Options . Puts are traded on various underlying assets , which can include stocks , currencies , commodities , and indexes . The buyer of a put option may sell , or exercise , the underlying asset at a specified strike price .
--------------------------
The Basics of Put Options . The value of a put option appreciates as the price of the underlying stock depreciates relative to the strike price . On the flip side , the value of a put option decreases as the underlying stock increases . A put option 's value also decreases as its expiration date approaches .

The Basics of Put Options . The possible payoff for a holder of a put is illustrated in the following diagram :

Reviewing Puts and Calls . Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from price movements in their underlying assets , which can be a commodity such as gold or stock . Derivatives are largely used as insurance products to hedge against the risk that a particular event may occur . The two main types of derivatives used for stocks are put and call options .

Reviewing Puts and Calls . A call option gives the holder the right , but not the obligation , to buy a stock at a certain price in the future . When an investor buys a call , she expects the value of the underlying asset to go up .

Reviewing Puts and Calls . A put option gives the holder the right , but not the obligation , to sell a stock at a certain price in the future . When an investor purchases a put , she expects the underlying asset to decline in price ; she may sell the option and gain a profit . An investor can also write a put option for another investor to buy , in which case , she would not expect the stock 's price to drop below the exercise price .
--------------------------
Example — How Does a Put Option Work ? . An investor purchases one put option contract on ABC company for $ 100 . Each option contract covers 100 shares . The exercise price of the shares is $ 10 , and the current ABC share price is $ 12 . This put option contract has given the investor the right , but not the obligation , to sell 100 shares of ABC at $ 10 .
--------------------------
Example — How Does a Put Option Work ? . If ABC shares drop to $ 8 , the investor 's put option is in the money ( ITM)—which means that the strike price is below the market price of the underlying asset — and she can close her option position by selling the contract on the open market .
--------------------------
Example — How Does a Put Option Work ? . On the other hand , she can purchase 100 shares of ABC at the existing market price of $ 8 , and then exercise her contract to sell the shares for $ 10 . Disregarding commissions , the profit for this position is $ 200 , or 100 x ( $ 10 - $ 8) . Remember that the investor paid a $ 100 premium for the put option , giving her the right to sell her shares at the exercise price . Factoring in this initial cost , her total profit is $ 200 - $ 100 = $ 100 .
--------------------------
Example — How Does a Put Option Work ? . As another way of working a put option as a hedge , if the investor in the previous example already owns 100 shares of ABC company , that position would be called a married put and could serve as a hedge against a decline in the share price .
