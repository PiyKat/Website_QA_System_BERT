What is a Portfolio Manager . A portfolio manager is a person or group of people responsible for investing a mutual , exchange - traded or closed - end fund 's assets , implementing its investment strategy and managing day - to - day portfolio trading . A portfolio manager is one of the most important factors to consider when looking at fund investing . Portfolio management can be active or passive , and historical performance records indicate that only a minority of active fund managers consistently beat the market .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Portfolio Manager . A portfolio manager holds great influence on a fund , no matter if that fund is a closed or open mutual fund , hedge fund , venture capital fund or exchange - traded fund . The manager of the fund 's portfolio will directly affect the overall returns of the fund . Portfolio managers , therefore , are usually experienced investors , brokers or traders , with strong backgrounds in financial management and track records of sustained success .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Portfolio Manager . A portfolio manager , regardless of background , is either an active manager or passive manager . If a manager takes a passive approach , his investment strategy mirrors a specific market index . With these funds , the market index used as a benchmark is extremely important since an investor should expect to see similar returns over the long term .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Portfolio Manager . Conversely , a manager can take an active approach to investing ; meaning that he attempts to consistently beat average market returns . In this scenario , the portfolio manager himself is extremely important , since his investment style directly results in the fund 's returns . Potential investors should look at the active fund 's marketing material for more information on the investment approach .
--------------------------
Important Aspects of a Portfolio Manager . Regardless of the investment approach , all portfolio managers need to have very specific qualities in order to be successful . The first is originating ideas . If the portfolio manager is active , then the ability to have original investment insight is paramount . With over 7,000 companies to choose from , active investors need to be smart about where they look . If the manager takes a passive approach , the originating insight comes in the form of the market index he 's decided to mirror . Passive managers must also make smart choices about the index .
--------------------------
Important Aspects of a Portfolio Manager . Additionally , the way in which a portfolio manager conducts research is very important . Active managers make a list of thousands of companies and pair it down to a list of a few hundred . The shortlist is then given to fund analysts to analyze the fundamentals of the potential investments , after which the portfolio manager assesses the companies and makes an investment decision . Passive managers also conduct research by looking at the various passive approaches and choosing the one best - suited for the fund .
