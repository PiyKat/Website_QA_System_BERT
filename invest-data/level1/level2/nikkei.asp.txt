What Is the Nikkei ? . The Nikkei is short for Japan 's Nikkei 225 Stock Average , the leading and most - respected index of Japanese stocks . It is a price - weighted index composed of Japan 's top 225 blue - chip companies traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange . The Nikkei is equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index in the United States .
--------------------------
Understanding Nikkei . Formerly called the Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average ( from 1975 to 1985 ) , it is now named after the " Nihon Keizai Shimbun " or Japan Economic Newspaper , commonly known as Nikkei , which sponsors the calculation of the index . The index has been calculated since September 1950 , retroactive to May 1949 . Among the best - known companies included in the Nikkei index are Canon Incorporated , Sony Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation . It is the oldest stock index in Asia .
--------------------------
Understanding Nikkei . The Nikkei was established as part of the rebuilding and industrialization of Japan in the aftermath of the Second World War . Constituent stocks are ranked by share price , rather than by market capitalization as is common in most indexes . Valuations are denominated in Japanese yen . The composition of the Nikkei is reviewed every September , and any needed changes take place in October .
--------------------------
Background to the Nikkei . The Tokyo Stock Exchange was established in 1878 . In 1943 , during the Second World War , the Japanese government combined the TSE with five others to form a single Japanese Stock Exchange . That exchange was closed down in August 1945 toward the end of the war . The Tokyo Stock Exchange re - opened on May 16 , 1949 , under the aegis of the new Securities Exchange Act .
--------------------------
Background to the Nikkei . Japan experienced a major asset bubble in the late 1980s when the government used fiscal and monetary stimuli to counteract a recession caused by the Japanese yen 's 50 % appreciation during the first part of the decade . According to TraderHQ , stock prices and land values tripled between 1985 and 1989 ; at the height of the bubble , the TSE accounted for 60 % of global stock market capitalization .
--------------------------
Background to the Nikkei . The bubble burst in 1990 , and the value of the Nikkei Index fell by one - third that year . According to Seeking Alpha , in October 2008 , the Nikkei traded below 7,000 ; this was a decline of more than 80 % from its December 1989 high . It subsequently rebounded between June 2012 and June 2015 with the help of economic stimulus from the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan , but the Index was still nearly 50 % below the 1989 high .
--------------------------
Investing in the Nikkei Index . It is not possible to directly purchase an index , but there are several exchange traded funds ( ETFs ) whose components correlate to the Nikkei . ETFs that track the Nikkei and trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange include Blackrock Japan 's iShares Nikkei 225 and Nomura Asset Management 's Nikkei 225 Exchange Traded Fund . The MAXIS Nikkei 225 Index ETF is a dollar - denominated fund that trades on the New York Stock Exchange .
