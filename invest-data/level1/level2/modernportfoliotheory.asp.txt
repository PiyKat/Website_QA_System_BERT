What Is Modern Portfolio Theory ( MPT ) ? . Modern portfolio theory ( MPT ) is a theory on how risk - averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk , emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward . According to the theory , it 's possible to construct an " efficient frontier " of optimal portfolios offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk . This theory was pioneered by Harry Markowitz in his paper " Portfolio Selection , " published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance . He was later awarded a Nobel prize for developing the MPT .
--------------------------
Understanding Modern Portfolio Theory ( MPT ) . Modern portfolio theory argues that an investment 's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone , but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio 's risk and return .
--------------------------
Understanding Modern Portfolio Theory ( MPT ) . MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk . Likewise , given a desired level of expected return , an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk . Based on statistical measures such as variance and correlation , an individual investment 's return is less important than how the investment behaves in the context of the entire portfolio .
--------------------------
Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . MPT makes the assumption that investors are risk - averse , meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return . This implies that an investor will take on more risk only if he or she is expecting more reward .
--------------------------
Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . The expected return of the portfolio is calculated as a weighted sum of the individual assets ' returns . If a portfolio contained four equally - weighted assets with expected returns of 4 , 6 , 10 , and 14 % , the portfolio 's expected return would be :
--------------------------
Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . ( 4 % x 25 % ) + ( 6 % x 25 % ) + ( 10 % x 25 % ) + ( 14 % x 25 % ) = 8.5 %
--------------------------
Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . The portfolio 's risk is a complicated function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets . To calculate the risk of a four - asset portfolio , an investor needs each of the four assets ' variances and six correlation values , since there are six possible two - asset combinations with four assets . Because of the asset correlations , the total portfolio risk , or standard deviation , is lower than what would be calculated by a weighted sum .
--------------------------
Efficient Frontier . Every possible combination of assets that exists can be plotted on a graph , with the portfolio 's risk on the X - axis and the expected return on the Y - axis . This plot reveals the most desirable portfolios . For example , assume Portfolio A has an expected return of 8.5 % and a standard deviation of 8 % , and that Portfolio B has an expected return of 8.5 % and a standard deviation of 9.5 % . Portfolio A would be deemed more " efficient " because it has the same expected return but lower risk . It is possible to draw an upward sloping hyperbola to connect all of the most efficient portfolios , and this is known as the efficient frontier . Investing in any portfolio not on this curve is not desirable .
