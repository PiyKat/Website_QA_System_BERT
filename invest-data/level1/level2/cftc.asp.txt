What Is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ? . The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) is an independent U.S. federal agency established by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 . The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates the commodity futures and options markets . Its goals include the promotion of competitive and efficient futures markets and the protection of investors against manipulation , abusive trade practices , and fraud .
--------------------------
Understanding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . The CFTC has five committees , each headed by a commissioner who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate . These five committees focus on agriculture , global markets , energy and environmental markets , technology , and cooperation between the CFTC and SEC . The committees are populated by individuals who represent the interests of specific industries , traders , futures exchanges , commodities exchanges , consumers and the environment .
--------------------------
Understanding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . The Commodity Exchange Act ( CEA ) regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States . Passed in 1936 and amended several times since , the CEA establishes the statutory framework under which the CFTC operates . Under this Act , the CFTC has authority to establish regulations that are published in Title 17 , Chapter I , of the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) .
--------------------------
New Challenges for the CFTC . The CFTC is moving away from its historic role as regulator of traditional commodity products - related futures and options contracts to face new challenges in the digital age of the 21st century .
--------------------------
New Challenges for the CFTC . A new challenge facing the CFTC is in relation to new financial technology ( FinTech ) products and crypto - currencies like Bitcoin , which had a Bitcoin futures contract launched in late 2017 that trades with the CME Group . The CFTC says that FinTech is driving innovation in financial markets across the globe . New technologies are wide - ranging in scope , from cloud computing and algorithmic trading to distributed ledgers to artificial intelligence and machine learning to network cartography and many others . These technologies have the potential for significant or even transformational impact on CFTC - regulated markets and the agency itself . The CFTC plans to play an active role in the oversight of this emerging innovation .
--------------------------
New Challenges for the CFTC . The CFTC plays an important role in regulating financial markets . Without such regulation and regulators , market participants could be subjected to fraud by unscrupulous individuals and , in turn , lose faith in our capital markets . This could make capital markets ineffective at efficiently allocating financial resources to the most deserving means of production and productive economic activities to the detriment of investors , consumers and society . Time will show if the agency is up to the new challenges it faces .
