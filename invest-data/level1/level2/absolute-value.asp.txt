What Is Absolute Value ? . Absolute value , also known as an intrinsic value , refers to a business valuation method that uses discounted cash flow ( DCF ) analysis to determine a company 's financial worth . The absolute value method differs from the relative value models that examine what a company is worth compared to its competitors . Absolute value models try to determine a company 's intrinsic worth based on its projected cash flows .
--------------------------
Understanding Absolute Values . Finding out whether a stock is under or overvalued is a primary play of value investors . Value investors use popular metrics like the price - to - earnings ratio ( P / E ) and the price - to - book ratio ( P / B ) to determine whether to buy or sell a stock based on its estimated worth . In addition to using these ratios as a valuation guide , another way to determine absolute value is the discounted cash flow ( DCF ) valuation analysis .
--------------------------
Understanding Absolute Values . Some form of a company ’s future cash flows ( CF ) is estimated with a DCF model and is then discounted to the present value in order to determine an absolute value for the company . The present value is regarded as the true worth or intrinsic value of the firm . By comparing what a company 's share price should be given its absolute value to the price that the stock is actually trading at , investors can determine if a stock is currently under or overvalued .
--------------------------
Understanding Absolute Values . Examples of methods used under the DCF model include the following models :

Understanding Absolute Values . All of these models require a rate of return or discount rate which is used to discount a firm ’s cash flows — dividends , earnings , operating cash flow ( OCF ) , or free cash flow ( FCF)—to get the absolute value of the firm . Depending on the method employed to run a valuation analysis , the investor or analyst could use either the cost of equity or the weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) as a discount rate .

. Investors can use a discounted cash flow valuation analysis to determine the absolute value of a company .

Absolute Value vs. Relative Value . Relative value is the opposite of absolute value . While absolute value examines the intrinsic value of an asset or company without comparing it to any others , relative value is based on the value of similar assets or companies . Analysts and investors who use relative value analysis for stocks look at financial statements and other multiples of the companies they 're interested in and compare it to other , similar firms to determine if those potential companies are over or undervalued . For instance , an investor will look at the variables — market capitalization , revenues , sales figures , P / E ratios , etc.—for companies like Amazon , Target , and/or Costco if they want to know the relative value of Walmart .
--------------------------
Challenges of Using Absolute Value . Estimating a company ’s absolute value does not come without its setbacks . Forecasting the cash flows with complete certainty and projecting how long the cash flows will remain on a growth trajectory is challenging . In addition to predicting an accurate growth rate , evaluating an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value can be difficult .
--------------------------
Challenges of Using Absolute Value . Since the absolute valuation approach to determining the worth of a stock is strictly based on the characteristics and fundamentals of the company under analysis , there is no comparison made to other companies in the same sector or industry . But companies within the same sector should be considered when analyzing a firm since a market - moving activity — a bankruptcy , government regulatory changes , disruptive innovation , employee layoffs , mergers and acquisitions , etc.—in any one of these companies can affect how the entire sector moves . Therefore , the best way to evaluate a stock ’s real value is to incorporate a mix of both the absolute and relative value methods .
--------------------------
Example of Absolute Value . Consider Company X , which currently trades on the market for $ 370.50 . After running a DCF analysis on its estimated future cash flows , an analyst determines that the absolute value of the firm is $ 450.30 . This presents a buying opportunity for an investor who is led to believe , based on the numbers , that Company X is undervalued .
