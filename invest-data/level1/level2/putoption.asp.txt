What Is a Put Option ? . A put option is a contract giving the owner the right , but not the obligation , to sell a specified amount of an underlying security at a pre - determined price within a specified time frame . The specified price the put option buyer can sell at is called the strike price .
--------------------------
What Is a Put Option ? . Put options are traded on various underlying assets , including stocks , currencies , bonds , commodities , and indexes . A put can be contrasted with a call option , which gives the holder to buy the underlying at a specified price on or before expiration . They are key to understanding when choosing whether to perform a straddle or a strangle .
--------------------------
How Do Put Options Work ? . A put option becomes more valuable as the price of the underlying stock depreciates relative to the strike price . Conversely , a put option loses its value as the underlying stock increases . Because put options essentially provide a short position in the underlying asset , they are used for hedging purposes or to speculate on downside price action . A protective put is used to ensure that losses in the underlying asset do not exceed a certain amount , namely the strike price .
--------------------------
How Do Put Options Work ? . In general , the value of a put option decreases as its time to expiration approaches due to time decay , because the probability of the stock falling below the specified strike price decreases . When an option loses its time value , the intrinsic value is left over , which is equivalent to the difference between the strike price less the underlying stock price . If an option has intrinsic value , it is in the money ( ITM ) .
--------------------------
How Do Put Options Work ? . Out of the money ( OTM ) and at the money put options have no intrinsic value because there would be no benefit of exercising the option . Investors could short sell the stock at the current higher market price , rather than exercising an out of the money put option at an undesirable strike price .
--------------------------
How Do Put Options Work ? . Time value , or extrinsic value , is reflected in the premium of the option . If the strike price of a put option is $ 20 , and the underlying is stock is currently trading at $ 19 , there is $ 1 of intrinsic value in the option . But the put option may trade for $ 1.35 . The extra $ 0.35 is time value , since the underlying stock price could change before the option expires .

Alternatives to Exercising a Put Option . The put seller , known as the " writer " , does not need to hold an option until expiration , and neither does the option buyer . As the underlying stock price moves , the premium of the option will change to reflect the recent underlying price movements . The option buyer can sell their option at any time , either to cut their loss and recoup part of the premium ( if OTM ) , or lock in a profit ( if ITM ) .

Alternatives to Exercising a Put Option . Similarly , the option writer can do the same thing . If the underlying 's price is above the strike price they may do nothing because the option may expire worthless and they can keep the whole premium . But if the underlying 's price is approaching or dropping below the strike price , to avoid a big loss the option writer may simply buy the option back , getting them out of the position . The profit or loss is the difference between the premium collected and premium paid to get out of the position .

Real World Examples of Put Options . Assume an investor owns one put option on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY)—currently trading at $ 277.00—with a strike price of $ 260 expiring in one month . For this option they paid a premium of $ 0.72 , or $ 72 ( $ 0.72 x 100 shares ) .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Put Options . The investor has the right to sell 100 shares of XYZ at a price of $ 260 until the expiration date in one month , which is usually the third Friday of the month , though it can be weekly .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Put Options . If shares of SPY fall to $ 250 and the investor exercises the option , the investor could purchase 100 shares of SPY for $ 250 in the market and sell the shares to the option 's writer for $ 260 each . Consequently , the investor would make $ 1,000 ( 100 x ( $ 260-$250 ) ) on the put option , less the $ 72 cost they paid for the option . Net profit is $ 1,000 - $ 72 = $ 928 , less any commission costs . The maximum loss on the trade is limited to the premium paid , or $ 72 . The maximum profit is attained if SPY falls to $ 0 .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Put Options . Contrary to a long put option , a short or written put option obligates an investor to take delivery , or purchase shares , of the underlying stock .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Put Options . Assume an investor is bullish on SPY , which is currently trading at $ 277 , and does not believe it will fall below $ 260 over the next two months . The investor could collect a premium of $ 0.72 ( x 100 shares ) by writing one put option on SPY with a strike price of $ 260 .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Put Options . The option writer would collect a total of $ 72 ( $ 0.72 x 100 ) . If SPY stays above the $ 260 strike price , the investor would keep the premium collected since the options would expire out of the money and be worthless . This is the maximum profit on the trade : $ 72 , or the premium collected .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Put Options . Conversely , if SPY moves below $ 260 , the investor is on on the hook for purchasing 100 shares at $ 260 , even if the stock falls to $ 250 , or $ 200 , or lower . No matter how far the stock falls , the put option writer is liable for purchasing shares at $ 260 , meaning they face theoretical risk of $ 260 per share , or $ 26,000 per contract ( $ 260 x 100 shares ) if the underlying stock falls to zero .
