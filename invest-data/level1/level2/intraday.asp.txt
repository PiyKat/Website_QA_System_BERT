These securities include stocks and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) . Intraday also signifies the highs and lows that the asset crossed throughout the day . Intraday price movements are particularly significant to short - term or day traders looking to make multiple trades over the course of a single trading session . These busy traders will settle all their positions when the market closes .

The Basics of Intraday Trading . Intraday is often used to refer to the new highs and lows of any particular security .

During the day , as indicated in the " day 's range " listed to the right of the closing price , shares dropped as low as $ 191.05—the intraday low — and hit a peak of $ 194.46—the intraday high .
