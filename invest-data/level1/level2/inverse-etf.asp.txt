What Is an Inverse ETF ? . An inverse ETF is an exchange - traded fund ( ETF ) constructed by using various derivatives to profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark . Investing in inverse ETFs is similar to holding various short positions , which involve borrowing securities and selling them with the hope of repurchasing them at a lower price .
--------------------------
What Is an Inverse ETF ? . An inverse ETF is also known as a " Short ETF , " or " Bear ETF . "
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Explained . Many inverse ETFs utilize daily futures contracts to produce their returns . A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell an asset or security at a set time and price . Futures allow investors to make a bet on the direction of a securities price .
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Explained . Inverse ETFs use of derivatives — like futures contracts — allows investors to make a bet that the market will decline . If the market falls , the inverse ETF rises by roughly the same percentage minus fees and commissions from the broker .
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Explained . Inverse ETFs are not long - term investments since the derivative contracts are bought and sold daily by the fund 's manager . As a result , there is no way to guarantee that the inverse ETF will match the long - term performance of the index or stocks it is tracking . The frequent trading often increases fund expenses and some inverse ETFs can carry expense ratios of 1 % or more .
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Vs . Short Selling . An advantage of inverse ETFs is that they do not require the investor to hold a margin account as would be the case for investors looking to enter into short positions .
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Vs . Short Selling . A margin account is one where a broker lends money to an investor to trade . Margin is used with shorting — an advance trading activity . Investors borrow the securities — they do n't own them — so that they can sell them to other traders . The goal is to buy the asset back at a lower price and unwind the trade by returning the shares to the margin lender . However , there is the risk that the value of the security rises instead of falling and the investor has to buy back the securities at a higher price than the original margined sale price .
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Vs . Short Selling . In addition to a margin account , short selling requires a stock loan fee paid to a broker for borrowing the shares necessary to sell short . Stocks with high short interest may result in difficulty finding shares to be short , which drives up the cost of short selling . In many cases , the cost of borrowing shares to short can exceed 3 % of the borrowed amount . You can see why inexperienced traders can quickly get in - over - their - heads .
--------------------------
Inverse ETFs Vs . Short Selling . Conversely , inverse ETFs often have expense ratios of less than 2 % and can be purchased by anyone with a brokerage account . Despite the expense ratios , it is still easier and less costly for an investor to take a position in an inverse ETF than it is to sell stocks short .

Types of Inverse ETFs . There are several inverse ETFs that can be used to profit from declines in broad market indexes , such as the Russell 2000 or the Nasdaq 100 . Also , there are inverse ETFs that focus on specific sectors , such as financials , energy , or consumer staples .
--------------------------
Types of Inverse ETFs . Some investors use inverse ETFs to profit from market declines while others use them to hedge their portfolios against falling prices . For example , investors who own an ETF that matches the S&P 500 can hedge declines in the S&P by owning an inverse ETF for the S&P. However , hedging has risks as well . If the S&P rises , investors would have to sell their inverse ETFs since they 'll be experiencing losses offsetting any gains in their original S&P investment .
--------------------------
Types of Inverse ETFs . Inverse ETFs are short - term trading instruments that must be timed perfectly for investors to make money . There 's a significant risk of losses if investors allocate too much money to inverse ETFs and time their entries and exits poorly .
--------------------------
Double and Triple Inverse Funds . A leveraged ETF is a fund that uses derivatives and debt to magnify the returns of an underlying index . Typically , an ETF 's price rises or falls on a one - to - one basis compared to the index it tracks . A leveraged ETF is designed to boost the returns to 2:1 or 3:1 compared to the index .
--------------------------
Double and Triple Inverse Funds . Leveraged inverse ETFs use the same concept as leveraged products and aim to deliver a magnified return when the market is falling . For example , if the S&P has declined by 2 % , a 2X - leveraged inverse ETF will deliver a 4 % return to the investor excluding fees and commissions .
--------------------------
Real World Example of an Inverse ETF . SH - ProShares Short S&P500 ( SH ) provides inverse exposure to large and midsize companies in the S&P 500 . It has an expense ratio of 0.89 % and over $ 1.77 billion in AUM . The ETF aims to provide a one - day trading bet and is not designed to be held for more than one day .
--------------------------
Real World Example of an Inverse ETF . In Dec. 2018 , the S&P declined , and as a result , beginning Dec. 13 , 2018 , the SH rose from $ 29.88 to $ 33.59 by Dec. 24 , 2018 . If investors had been in the SH during those days , they would have realized gains .
--------------------------
Real World Example of an Inverse ETF . However , in 2019 , the S&P recovered and bounced back whereby the SH traded Jan. 03 , 2019 , for $ 32.12 and fell to $ 27.35 by April 01 , 2019 .
