What is an Asset - Backed Security ? . An asset - backed security ( ABS ) is a financial security such as a bond or note which is collateralized by a pool of assets such as loans , leases , credit card debt , royalties , or receivables . For investors , asset - backed securities are an alternative to investing in corporate debt . An ABS is similar to a mortgage - backed security , except that the underlying securities are not mortgage - based .
--------------------------
Understanding Asset - Backed Securities . Asset - backed securities allow issuers to generate more cash , which , in turn , is used for more lending , while giving investors the opportunity to invest in a wide variety of income - generating assets . Usually , the underlying assets of an ABS are illiquid and ca n't be sold on their own . However , pooling the assets together and creating a financial security , a process called securitization , enables the owner of the assets to make them marketable . The underlying assets of these pools may be home equity loans , automobile loans , credit card receivables , student loans , or other expected cash flows . Issuers of ABS can be as creative as they desire . For example , ABS have been created based on cash flows from movie revenues , royalty payments , aircraft leases , and solar photovoltaics . Just about any cash - producing situation can be securitized into an ABS .
--------------------------
Example of an Asset - Backed Security . Assume that Company X is in the business of making automobile loans . If a person wants to borrow money to buy a car , Company X gives that person the cash , and the person is obligated to repay the loan with a certain amount of interest . Perhaps Company X makes so many loans that it runs out of cash to continue making more loans . Company X can then package its current loans and sell them to Investment Firm X , thus receiving cash that it can use to make more loans .
--------------------------
Example of an Asset - Backed Security . Investment Firm X will then sort the purchased loans into different groups called tranches . These tranches are groups of loans with similar characteristics , such as maturity , interest rate , and expected delinquency rate . Next , Investment Firm X will issue securities that are similar to typical bonds on each tranche it creates .
--------------------------
Example of an Asset - Backed Security . Individual investors then purchase these securities and receive the cash - flows from the underlying pool of auto loans , minus an administrative fee that Investment Firm X keeps for itself .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . An ABS will usually have three tranches : class A , B and C. The senior tranche , A , is almost always the largest tranche and is structured to have an investment - grade rating to make it attractive to investors .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . The B tranche has lower credit quality and , thus , has a higher yield than the senior tranche . The C tranche has a lower credit rating than the B tranche and might have such poor credit quality that it ca n't be sold to investors . In this case , the issuer would keep the C tranche and absorb the losses .
