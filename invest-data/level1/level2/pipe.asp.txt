What Is a Private Investment in Public Equity – PIPE ? . Private investment in public equity ( PIPE ) is the buying of shares of publicly traded stock at a price below the current market value ( CMV ) per share . This buying method is a practice of investment firms , mutual funds , and other large , accredited investors . A traditional PIPE is one in which common or preferred stock is issued at a set price to the investor — a structured PIPE issues common or preferred shares of convertible debt .
--------------------------
What Is a Private Investment in Public Equity – PIPE ? . The purpose of a PIPE is for the issuer of the stock to raise capital for the public company . This financing technique is more efficient than secondary offerings , due to fewer regulatory issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
--------------------------
How a Private Investment in Public Equity Works . A publicly traded company may utilize a PIPE when securing funds for working capital , expansion , or acquisitions . The company may create new stock shares or use some from its supply , but the equities never go on sale on a stock exchange . Instead , these large investors purchase the company 's stock in a private placement , and the issuer files a resale registration statement with the SEC .
--------------------------
How a Private Investment in Public Equity Works . The issuing business typically obtains its funding — that is , the investors ' money for the shares — within two to three weeks , rather than waiting several months or longer , as it would with a secondary stock offering . Registration of the new shares with the SEC typically becomes effective within a month of filing .
--------------------------
Considerations for PIPE Buyers . PIPE investors may purchase stock below the market price as a hedge of protection against the share price going down after news of the PIPE gets out . The discount also acts as compensation for a certain lack of liquidity in the shares . Since this offering was a PIPE , the buyers can not sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC . However , an issuer generally can not sell more than 20 % of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders .
--------------------------
Considerations for PIPE Buyers . A traditional PIPE agreement lets investors purchase common stock or preferred stock that is convertible to common shares at a predetermined price or exchange rate . If the business is merged with another or sold soon , investors may be able to receive dividends or other payoffs . Because of these benefits , traditional PIPEs are typically priced at or near the stock ’s market value .
--------------------------
Considerations for PIPE Buyers . With a structured PIPE , preferred stock or debt securities convertible to common stock are sold . If the securities contain a reset clause , new investors are shielded from downside risks , but existing stockholders are exposed to the greater risk of dilution in share values . For this reason , a structured PIPE transaction may need prior stockholder approval .
--------------------------
Advantages and Disadvantages of PIPEs . Private investment in public equity carries several advantageous for issuers . Large amounts of shares are typically sold to knowledgeable investors long term , ensuring the company secures the funding it needs . PIPEs can be particularly advantageous for small- to medium - sized public companies that may have a hard time accessing more traditional forms of equity financing .
--------------------------
Advantages and Disadvantages of PIPEs . Because PIPE shares do not need to be registered in advance with the SEC or meet all the usual federal registration requirements for public stock offerings , transactions proceed more efficiently with fewer administrative requirements .
--------------------------
Advantages and Disadvantages of PIPEs . However , on the downside , investors may sell their stock in a short amount of time , driving down the market price . If the market price drops below a set threshold , the company may have to issue additional stock at a significantly reduced price . This new share issue dilutes the value of shareholders ’ investments .
--------------------------
Advantages and Disadvantages of PIPEs . Short sellers may take advantage of the situation by repeatedly selling their shares and lowering the share price , potentially resulting in PIPE investors having majority ownership of the company . Setting a minimum share price below which no compensatory stock is issued can avoid this problem .
