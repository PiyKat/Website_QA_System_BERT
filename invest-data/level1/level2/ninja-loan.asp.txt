What is a NINJA Loan ? . A NINJA loan is a slang term for a loan extended to a borrower , with little or no attempt by the lender to verify the applicant 's ability to repay . It stands for " no income , no job and no assets . " Whereas most lenders require loan applicants to provide evidence of a stable stream of income or sufficient collateral , a NINJA loan ignores that verification process .
--------------------------
What is a NINJA Loan ? . NINJA loans were more common prior to the 2008 financial crisis . In the aftermath of the crisis , the U.S. government issued new regulations to improve standard lending practices across the credit market , which included tightening the requirements for granting loans . At this point , NINJA loans are rare , if not extinct .
--------------------------
How a NINJA Loan Works . Financial institutions that offer NINJA loans base their decision on a borrower ’s credit score , with no verification of income or assets , such as through income tax returns , pay stubs or bank and brokerage statements . Borrowers need to have a credit score over a certain threshold in order to qualify . Since NINJA loans are generally provided through subprime lenders , however , their credit score requirements may be lower than those of mainstream lenders , such as major banks .
--------------------------
How a NINJA Loan Works . NINJA loans are structured with varying terms . Some may offer an attractively low initial interest rate that increases over time . Borrowers are required to repay the debt according to a scheduled time frame . Failing to make those payments can cause the lender to take legal action to collect the debt , resulting in a drop in the borrower 's credit score and ability to obtain other loans in the future .
--------------------------
Pros and Cons of NINJA Loans . Because NINJA loans require so little paperwork compared , for example , with traditional home mortgages or business loans , an application for one can be processed quickly . That makes them appealing to some borrowers , especially those who lack the customary documentation or do n't wish to produce it .
--------------------------
Pros and Cons of NINJA Loans . The loans can , however , be very risky – for lender and borrower alike . Because NINJA loans require no evidence of collateral , they are not secured by any assets that a lender could seize if the borrower defaults on the loan .

. NINJA loans can be very risky for borrower and lender alike .
--------------------------
. NINJA loans are also risky for the borrower , unfettered as they are by the traditionally conservative bank underwriting practices that often keep both sides out of trouble . Borrowers may be encouraged to take out larger loans than they can reasonably expect to repay , especially if they focus on a low introductory interest rate that will rise in the future .
--------------------------
. After a high level of loan defaults helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis and a crash in real estate values in many parts of the country , the government imposed stricter rules on lenders , making loans more highly regulated than before , with mortgage loans seeing the greatest impact . The 2010 Dodd – Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created new standards for lending and loan applications . The new rules largely did away with NINJA loans , requiring lenders to obtain more comprehensive information about prospective borrowers , including not only their credit scores but also documented evidence of their employment and other income sources .
