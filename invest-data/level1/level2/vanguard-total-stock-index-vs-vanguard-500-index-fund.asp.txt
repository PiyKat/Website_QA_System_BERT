Vanguard 's Total Stock Market Index vs. 500 Index Funds : An Overview . Two of the investment company Vanguard 's most popular products are the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund .

As its name implies , the Total Stock Market Index Fund provides exposure to the entire U.S. equities market , as represented by the Center for Research in Securities Prices ( CRSP ) U.S. Total Market Index of over 3,550 stocks , whereas the 500 Index Fund only provides exposure to 500 of the largest U.S. companies , similar to the S&P 500 Index .

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund . The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ( VTSAX ) provides diversified exposure to small- , mid- , and large - cap growth and value stocks , traded on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) .

Vanguard 500 Index Fund . The first index fund for individual investors , according to the company , the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ( VFIAX ) provides exposure to a subset of the entire U.S. equity market — specifically , the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index , whose component companies account for about three - fourths of the U.S. stock market ’s value . The Vanguard 500 Index Fund seeks to replicate its benchmark index by investing its total net assets in the stocks comprising the index and holding each component with approximately the same weight as the index . In this way , the fund barely deviates from the S&P , which it is designed to mimic .

However , the Sharpe ratios ( the most widely used method for calculating risk - adjusted return ) are nearly identical , which indicates that investors in both funds had similar returns on a risk - adjusted basis .
--------------------------
Key Differences . The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is best suited for moderately to highly risk - tolerant investors seeking low - cost exposure to the U.S. stock market . Additionally , it could function as a single domestic equity fund in a portfolio .
--------------------------
Key Differences . Meanwhile , the Vanguard 500 Index Fund is suitable as a core equity holding for investors with a long - term investment horizon and a preference for the lower risk of the large - cap equity market . Since it does concentrate on more conservative , large - cap stocks , the fund might work best in a diversified portfolio that contains exposure to other types of equities for growth .
