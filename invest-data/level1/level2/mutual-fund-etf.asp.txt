Mutual Funds vs. ETFs : An Overview . Mutual funds and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) are both created from the concept of pooled fund investing , often adhering to a passive , indexed strategy that tries to track or replicate representative benchmark indices . Pooled funds bundle securities together to offer investors the benefit of a diversified portfolio . The pooled fund concept primarily offers diversification and comes with economies of scale , allowing managers to decrease transaction costs through large lot share transactions with pooled investment capital .
--------------------------
Similarities . Both mutual funds and ETFs will typically have anywhere from 100 to 3,000 different individual securities within the fund . Both types of investments are also primarily regulated by the three principal securities laws enacted after the market crash of 1929 .
--------------------------
Similarities . While these two investment products are built from the same pooled fund concept and regulated by the same principal securities laws , there are unquestionably some significant differences between the choices . These differences can be appealing depending on the investor .
--------------------------
3,000 . The maximum number of securities typically found within a mutual fund or tracked by an ETF ; the minimum number is typically at least 100 .
--------------------------
Mutual Funds . MFS Investment Management offered the first U.S. mutual fund in 1924 . Since the 1920s mutual funds have been providing investors an extensive selection of pooled fund offerings . While some mutual funds are passively managed , many investors look to these securities for the added value they can offer in an actively managed strategy . For these investors , active management is the key differentiator as they rely on a professional manager to build an optimal portfolio rather than just following an index .
--------------------------
. Mutual funds offer a wide variety of actively - managed fund options , while ETFs tend to have more passively - managed options .
--------------------------
. Of the two options , as the leading , actively managed investment , mutual funds come with some added complexities . Typically , management fees will be higher for a mutual fund because managers are tasked with a more difficult job in identifying the best securities to fit the portfolio ’s strategy . Mutual funds have also had long - standing integrated into the full - service brokerage transaction process . This full - service offering is the primary reason for the structuring of share classes , and also may add some additional fee considerations .
--------------------------
. Mutual funds are created to be offered with multiple share classes . Each share class has its fee structuring that requires the investor to pay different types of sales loads to a broker . Different share classes also have varying types of operational fees .
--------------------------
. The operational fees of a mutual fund are comprehensively expressed to the investor through the expense ratio . The expense ratio is made up of management fees , operational expenses , and 12b-1 fees . 12b-1 fees are a fundamental differentiator between mutual funds and ETFs . The mutual fund requires 12b-1 fees to support the costs associated with selling the fund through full - service brokerage relationships . The 12b-1 fees are not needed with ETFs , and therefore , can make the mutual fund expense ratio slightly higher .
--------------------------
. It is also vital for an investor to understand the pricing of mutual funds . Mutual funds are priced based on a net asset value ( NAV ) which is calculated at the end of the trading day . Standard open - end mutual funds can only be bought and sold at their NAV which means an investor placing a trade during the trading day must wait until the final price is calculated to transact their order .
--------------------------
. Mutual fund fees are typically higher than those of ETFs , largely because the majority of mutual funds are actively - managed , which requires more manpower and input than the more often passively - managed ETFs .
--------------------------
Exchange Traded Funds . The first ETFs began trading in the 1990s . Regulations primarily required these funds to be passively managed with securities tracking an index . In 2008 , regulatory changes began to make actively managed ETFs available for U.S. investors .
--------------------------
Exchange Traded Funds . Historically , ETFs have been popular for index investors seeking to gain exposure to a particular market segment with the benefits of having diversification across the sector . Following the 2008 market crisis , the popularity of smart beta funds began to increase . Within the ETF offering arena , smart beta provides a type of customized index product built around a factor - based index methodology . This customization lets investors choose from index options with selected fundamental characteristics which , in many cases , can substantially outperform . With the evolution of smart beta index funds , ETF options have widened , giving investors a broader variety of passive ETF choices .
--------------------------
Exchange Traded Funds . Fees are also an important consideration for ETF investors . ETFs do not carry sales load fees . Investors will pay a commission if required for trading them , but many ETFs trade for free . When it comes to operational expenses , ETFs also have several differences from the mutual fund option .
--------------------------
Exchange Traded Funds . ETF expenses are usually lower for a few reasons . ETFs have lower management fees because many of them are passive funds which do not require stock analysis from the fund manager . Transaction fees are also typically lower as less trading is needed . As mentioned , ETFs also do not charge 12b-1 fees which decreases the overall expense ratio .
--------------------------
Exchange Traded Funds . The pricing of ETFs also differs from mutual fund pricing . An important consideration when comparing the two . ETFs trade throughout the day on exchanges like a stock . This active trading can appeal to many investors who prefer real - time trading and transaction activity in their portfolio . Overall , the price of an ETF reflects the real - time pricing of the securities held within the portfolio .
--------------------------
Special Considerations — Taxes . Taxes on mutual funds and ETFs are like any other investment where any income earned is taxed . Investors must pay either the short - term or long - term capital gains tax when selling their shares for a profit . Short - term capital gains apply to shares held less than one year before selling . Long - term taxes include the profit from shares sold after holding for a year or longer .
--------------------------
Special Considerations — Taxes . For 2019 , short - term capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate . Long - term capital gains are taxed at 0 % , 15 % , and 20 % depending on the investor 's ordinary income tax bracket . Investors in mutual funds and ETFs must also pay taxes on any dividends they receive from the holding . Ordinary dividends are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate . Qualified dividends are taxed at the long - term capital gains rate .
--------------------------
Special Considerations — Taxes . Mutual funds typically have higher tax implications because they pay investors capital gains distributions . These capital distributions paid out by the mutual fund are taxable . ETFs usually do not payout capital distributions , and therefore , can have a slight tax advantage .
--------------------------
Special Considerations — Taxes . For investors who hold their assets in a tax - advantaged vehicle like a 401(k ) , this advantage disappears . 401(k)s and other qualified plans take contributions on a tax - deferred basis . Money that is deposited — up to certain yearly limits — is not subject to any income tax . Further , the investments in the account can grow tax - free and do not incur taxes when trades are made .
