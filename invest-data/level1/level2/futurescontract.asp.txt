What is a Futures Contract . A futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future . Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to facilitate trading on a futures exchange . The buyer of a futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy the underlying asset when the futures contract expires . The seller of the futures contract is taking on the obligation to provide the underlying asset at the expiration date .
--------------------------
Breaking Down the Futures Contract . " Futures contract " and " futures " refer to the same thing . For example , you might hear somebody say they bought oil futures , which means the same thing as an oil futures contract . When someone says " futures contract , " they 're typically referring to a specific type of future , such as oil , gold , bonds or S&P 500 index futures . The term " futures " is more general , and is often used to refer to the whole market , such as " They 're a futures trader . "
--------------------------
Example of Futures Contracts . Futures contracts are used by two categories of market participants : hedgers and speculators . Producers or purchasers of an underlying asset hedge or guarantee the price at which the commodity is sold or purchased , while portfolio managers and traders may also make a bet on the price movements of an underlying asset using futures .
--------------------------
Example of Futures Contracts . An oil producer needs to sell their oil . They may use futures contracts do it . This way they can lock in a price they will sell at , and then deliver the oil to the buyer when the futures contract expires . Similarly , a manufacturing company may need oil for making widgets . Since they like to plan ahead and always have oil coming in each month , they too may use futures contracts . This way they know in advance the price they will pay for oil ( the futures contract price ) and they know they will be taking delivery of the oil once the contract expires .
--------------------------
Example of Futures Contracts . Futures are available on many different types of assets . There are futures contracts on stock exchange indexes , commodities , and currencies .
--------------------------
Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Imagine an oil producer plans to produce one million barrels of oil over the next year . It will be ready for delivery in 12 months .
--------------------------
Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Assume the current price is $ 75 per barrel . The producer could produce the oil , and then sell it at the current market prices one year from today .
--------------------------
Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Given the volatility of oil prices , the market price at that time could be very different than the current price .
--------------------------
Mechanics of a Futures Contract . If oil producer thinks oil will be higher in one year , they may opt not to lock in a price now . But , if they think $ 75 is a good price , they could lock - in a guaranteed sale price by entering into a futures contract .
--------------------------
Mechanics of a Futures Contract . A mathematical model is used to price futures , which takes into account the current spot price , the risk - free rate of return , time to maturity , storage costs , dividends , dividend yields , and convenience yields . Assume that the one - year oil futures contracts are priced at $ 78 per barrel . By entering into this contract , in one year the producer is obligated to deliver one million barrels of oil and is guaranteed to receive $ 78 million . The $ 78 price per barrel is received regardless of where spot market prices are at the time .
--------------------------
Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Contracts are standardized . For example , one oil contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) is for 1,000 barrels of oil . Therefore , if someone wanted to lock in a price ( selling or buying ) on 100,000 barrels of oil , they would need to buy / sell 100 contracts . To lock in a price on one million barrels of oil / they would need to buy / sell 1,000 contracts .
--------------------------
Trading Futures Contracts . Retail traders and portfolio managers are not interested in delivering or receiving the underlying asset . A retail trader has little need to receive 1,000 barrels of oil , but they may interested in capturing a profit on the price moves of oil .
--------------------------
Trading Futures Contracts . Futures contracts can be traded purely for profit , as long as the trade is closed before expiration . Many futures contracts expire on the third Friday of the month , but contracts do vary so check the contract specifications of any and all contracts before trading them .
--------------------------
Trading Futures Contracts . For example , it is January and April contracts are trading at $ 55 . If a trader believes that the price of oil will rise before the contract expires in April , they could buy the contract at $ 55 . This gives them control of 1,000 barrels of oil . They are not required to pay $ 55,000 ( $ 55 x 1,000 barrels ) for this privilege , though . Rather , the broker only requires an initial margin payment , typically of a few thousand dollars for each contract .
--------------------------
Trading Futures Contracts . The profit or loss of the position fluctuates in the account as the price of the futures contract moves . If the loss gets too big , the broker will ask the trader to deposit more money to cover the loss . This is called maintenance margin .
--------------------------
Trading Futures Contracts . The final profit or loss of the trade is realized when the trade is closed . In this case , if the buyer sells the contract at $ 60 , they make $ 5,000 [ ( $ 60-$55 ) x 1000 ) . Alternatively , if the price drops to $ 50 and they close out the position there , they lose $ 5,000 .
