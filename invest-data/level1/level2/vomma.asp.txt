What Is Vomma ? . Vomma is the rate at which the vega of an option will react to volatility in the market . It is a second - order derivative for an option ’s value . Vomma demonstrates the convexity of vega . A positive value for vomma indicates that a percentage point increase in volatility will result in an increased option value which is demonstrated by vega ’s convexity .
--------------------------
What Is Vomma ? . Vomma is part of the group of measures known as the " Greeks " which are used in options pricing . Other measures include delta , gamma , and vega .
--------------------------
Understanding Vomma . Vomma and vega are two factors involved in understanding and identifying profitable option trades . The two work together in providing detail on an option 's price and the option price ’s sensitivity to market changes . They can influence the sensitivity and interpretation of the Black - Scholes pricing model for option pricing .
--------------------------
Vega . Vega helps an investor to understand a derivative option ’s sensitivity to volatility occurring from the underlying instrument . Vega provides the amount of expected positive or negative change in an option ’s price per 1 % change in the volatility of the underlying instrument . A positive vega indicates an increase in the option price and a negative vega indicates a decrease in the option price .
--------------------------
Vega . Vega is measured in whole numbers with values usually ranging from -20 to 20 . Higher time periods result in higher vegas . Vega values signify multiples representing losses and gains . For example , a vega of 5 on Stock A at $ 100 would indicate a loss of $ 5 for every point decrease in implied volatility and a gain of $ 5 for every point increase .

Vega . The formula for calculating vega is below :

Vega and Vomma . Vomma is a second - order Greek derivative which means that its value provides insight on how Vega will change with an implied volatility of the underlying instrument . If a positive vomma is calculated and volatility increases , vega on the option position will increase . If volatility falls , a positive vomma would indicate a decrease in vega . If vomma is negative , the opposite occurs with volatility changes as indicated by vega ’s convexity .
--------------------------
Vega and Vomma . Generally , investors with long options should look for a high , positive value for vomma , while investors with short options should look for a negative one .

Vega and Vomma . The formula for calculating vomma is below :

Using Vega and Vomma in Options Trading . Vega and vomma are measures that can be used in gauging the sensitivity of the Black - Scholes option pricing model to variables affecting option prices . They are considered along with the Black - Scholes pricing model when making investment decisions .
