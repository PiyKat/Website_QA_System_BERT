Authorized Participant . Authorized participants ( AP ) are one of the major parties at the center of the creation and redemption process for exchange - traded funds ( ETF ) . They provide a large portion of liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create a fund . When there is a shortage of shares in the market , the authorized participant creates more . Conversely , the authorized participant will reduce shares in circulation when supply falls short or demand . This can be done with the creation and redemption mechanism that keeps share prices aligned with its underlying net asset value ( NAV ) .
--------------------------
Breaking Down Authorized Participant . Authorized participants are responsible for acquiring the securities that the ETF wants to hold . If that is the S&P 500 index , they will purchase all its constituents in the same weight and deliver them to the sponsor . In return , authorized participants receive a block of equally valued shares called a creation unit . Issuers can use the services of one or more authorized participants for a fund . Large and active funds tend to have a greater number of authorized participants . This also differs between various types of funds . Equities , on average , have more participants than bonds , perhaps due to greater trading volume .

Breaking Down Authorized Participant . Traditionally , authorized participants are large banks like Bank of America ( BAC ) , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) , among others . They do not receive compensation from a sponsor and have no legal obligation to redeem or create the ETF 's shares . Instead , authorized participants are compensated through activity in the secondary market or service fees collected from clients yearning to execute primary trades .

Breaking Down Authorized Participant . In the end , both parties benefit from working together . The sponsor receives help in creating the fund while the participant gets a block of shares to resell for a profit . This process also works in reverse . Authorized participants receive the same value of the underlying security in the fund after selling shares .
--------------------------
Competition between Authorized Participants . Multiple authorized participants help improve the liquidity of a particular ETF . The threat of competition tends to keep the fund trading close to its fair value . More importantly , additional authorized participants encourage a better functioning market . When one party ceases to act as an authorized participant , other ones will see the product as a profitable opportunity and offer the creation / redemption technology . At the same time , the impacted authorized participant has the option to address any internal issues and resume primary market activities .
