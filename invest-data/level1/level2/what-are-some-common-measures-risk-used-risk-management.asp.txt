Common Methods of Measurement for Investment Risk Management . Risk management is a crucial process used to make investment decisions . The process involves identifying and analyzing the amount of risk involved in an investment , and either accepting that risk or mitigating it . Some common measures of risk include standard deviation , beta , value at risk ( VaR ) , and conditional value at risk ( CVaR ) .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation . Standard deviation measures the dispersion of data from its expected value . The standard deviation is used in making an investment decision to measure the amount of historical volatility associated with an investment relative to its annual rate of return . It indicates how much the current return is deviating from its expected historical normal returns . For example , a stock that has high standard deviation experiences higher volatility , and therefore , a higher level of risk is associated with the stock .
--------------------------
Beta . Beta is another common measure of risk . Beta measures the amount of systematic risk an individual security or an industrial sector has relative to the whole stock market . The market has a beta of 1 , and it can be used to gauge the risk of a security . If a security 's beta is equal to 1 , the security 's price moves in time step with the market . A security with a beta greater than 1 indicates that it is more volatile than the market .
--------------------------
Beta . Conversely , if a security 's beta is less than 1 , it indicates that the security is less volatile than the market . For example , suppose a security 's beta is 1.5 . In theory , the security is 50 percent more volatile than the market .
--------------------------
Beta . Value at Risk ( VaR ) is a statistical measure used to assess the level of risk associated with a portfolio or company . The VaR measures the maximum potential loss with a degree of confidence for a specified period . For example , suppose a portfolio of investments has a one - year 10 percent VaR of $ 5 million . Therefore , the portfolio has a 10 percent chance of losing more than $ 5 million over a one - year period .
--------------------------
Conditional Value at Risk ( CVaR ) . Conditional value at risk ( CVaR ) is another risk measure used to assess the tail risk of an investment . Used as an extension to the VaR , the CVaR assesses the likelihood , with a certain degree of confidence , that there will be a break in the VaR ; it seeks to assess what happens to investment beyond its maximum loss threshold . This measure is more sensitive to events that happen in the tail end of a distribution â€” the tail risk . For example , suppose a risk manager believes the average loss on an investment is $ 10 million for the worst one percent of possible outcomes for a portfolio . Therefore , the CVaR , or expected shortfall , is $ 10 million for the one percent tail .
--------------------------
Categories of Risk Management . Beyond the particular measures , risk management is divided into two broad categories : systematic and unsystematic risk .
--------------------------
Categories of Risk Management . Systematic risk is associated with the market . This risk affects the overall market of the security . It is unpredictable and undiversifiable ; however , the risk can be mitigated through hedging . For example , political upheaval is a systematic risk that can affect multiple financial markets , such as the bond , stock , and currency markets . An investor can hedge against this sort of risk by buying put options in the market itself .
--------------------------
Categories of Risk Management . The second category of risk , unsystematic risk , is associated with a company or sector . It is also known as diversifiable risk and can be mitigated through asset diversification . This risk is only inherent to a specific stock or industry . If an investor buys an oil stock , he assumes the risk associated with both the oil industry and the company itself .
--------------------------
Categories of Risk Management . For example , suppose an investor is invested in an oil company , and he believes the falling price of oil affects the company . The investor may look to take the opposite side of , or hedge , his position by buying a put option on crude oil or on the company , or he may look to mitigate the risk through diversification by buying stock in retail or airline companies . He mitigates some of the risk if he takes these routes to protect his exposure to the oil industry . If he is not concerned with risk management , the company 's stock and oil price could drop significantly , and he could lose his entire investment , severely impacting his portfolio .
