The Basics of Options Profitability . Options traders can profit by being an option buyer or an option writer . Options allow for potential profit during both volatile times , and when the market is quiet or less volatile . This is possible because the prices of assets like stocks , currencies , and commodities are always moving , and no matter what the market conditions are there is an options strategy that can take advantage of it .
--------------------------
Basics of Option Profitability . A call option buyer stands to make a profit if the underlying asset , let 's say a stock , rises above the strike price before expiry . A put option buyer makes a profit if the price falls below the strike price before the expiration . The exact amount of profit depends on the difference between the stock price and the option strike price at expiration or when the option position is closed .
--------------------------
Basics of Option Profitability . A call option writer stands to make a profit if the underlying stock stays below the strike price . After writing a put option , the trader profits if the price stays above the strike price . An option writer 's profitability is limited to the premium they receive for writing the option ( which is the option buyer 's cost ) . Option writers are also called option sellers .
--------------------------
Option Buying vs. Writing . An option buyer can make a substantial return on investment if the option trade works out . This is because a stock price can move significantly beyond the strike price .
--------------------------
Option Buying vs. Writing . An option writer makes a comparatively smaller return if the option trade is profitable . This is because the writer 's return is limited to the premium , no matter how much the stock moves . So why write options ? Because the odds are typically overwhelmingly on the side of the option writer . A study in the late 1990s , by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , found that a little over 75 % of all options held to expiration expired worthless .
--------------------------
Option Buying vs. Writing . This study excludes option positions that were closed out or exercised prior to expiration . Even so , for every option contract that was in the money ( ITM ) at expiration , there were three that were out of the money ( OTM ) and therefore worthless is a pretty telling statistic .
--------------------------
Evaluating Risk Tolerance . Here ’s a simple test to evaluate your risk tolerance in order to determine whether you are better off being an option buyer or an option writer . Let ’s say you can buy or write 10 call option contracts , with the price of each call at $ 0.50 . Each contract typically has 100 shares as the underlying asset , so 10 contracts would cost $ 500 ( $ 0.50 x 100 x 10 contracts ) .
--------------------------
Evaluating Risk Tolerance . If you buy 10 call option contracts , you pay $ 500 and that is the maximum loss that you can incur . However , your potential profit is theoretically limitless . So what ’s the catch ? The probability of the trade being profitable is not very high . While this probability depends on the implied volatility of the call option and the period of time remaining to expiration , let ’s say it 25 % .
--------------------------
Evaluating Risk Tolerance . On the other hand , if you write 10 call option contracts , your maximum profit is the amount of the premium income , or $ 500 , while your loss is theoretically unlimited . However , the odds of the options trade being profitable are very much in your favor , at 75 % .
--------------------------
Evaluating Risk Tolerance . So would you risk $ 500 , knowing that you have a 75 % chance of losing your investment and a 25 % chance of making a profit ? Or would you prefer to make a maximum of $ 500 , knowing that you have a 75 % chance of keeping the entire amount or part of it , but have a 25 % chance of the trade being a losing one ?
--------------------------
Evaluating Risk Tolerance . The answer to those questions will give you an idea of your risk tolerance and whether you are better off being an option buyer or option writer .
--------------------------
Evaluating Risk Tolerance . It is important to keep in mind that these are the general statistics that apply to all options , but at certain times it may be more beneficial to be an option writer or a buyer in a specific asset . Applying the right strategy at the right time could alter these odds significantly .
--------------------------
Option Strategies Risk / Reward . While calls and puts can be combined in various permutations to form sophisticated options strategies , let ’s evaluate the risk / reward of the four most basic strategies .
--------------------------
Option Strategies Risk / Reward . This is the most basic option strategy . It is a relatively low - risk strategy since the maximum loss is restricted to the premium paid to buy the call , while the maximum reward is potentially limitless . Although , as stated earlier , the odds of the trade being very profitable are typically fairly low . " Low risk " assumes that the total cost of the option represents a very small percentage of the trader 's capital . Risking all capital on a single call option would make it a very risky trade because all the money could be lost if the option expires worthless .
--------------------------
Option Strategies Risk / Reward . This is another strategy with relatively low risk but the potentially high reward if the trade works out . Buying puts is a viable alternative to the riskier strategy of short selling the underlying asset . Puts can also be bought to hedge downside risk in a portfolio . But because equity indices typically trend higher over time , which means that stocks on average tend to advance more often than they decline , the risk / reward profile of the put buyer is slightly less favorable than that of a call buyer .
--------------------------
Option Strategies Risk / Reward . Put writing is a favored strategy of advanced options traders since , in the worst - case scenario , the stock is assigned to the put writer ( they have to buy the stock ) , while the best - case scenario is that the writer retains the full amount of the option premium . The biggest risk of put writing is that the writer may end up paying too much for a stock if it subsequently tanks . The risk / reward profile of put writing is more unfavorable than that of put or call buying since the maximum reward equals the premium received , but the maximum loss is much higher . That said , as discussed before , the probability of being able to make a profit is higher .
--------------------------
Option Strategies Risk / Reward . Call writing comes in two forms , covered and naked . Covered call writing is another favorite strategy of intermediate to advanced option traders , and is generally used to generate extra income from a portfolio . It involves writing calls on stocks held within the portfolio . Uncovered or naked call writing is the exclusive province of risk - tolerant , sophisticated options traders , as it has a risk profile similar to that of a short sale in stock . The maximum reward in call writing is equal to the premium received . The biggest risk with a covered call strategy is that the underlying stock will be “ called away . ” With naked call writing , the maximum loss is theoretically unlimited , just as it is with a short sale .
--------------------------
Option Strategies Risk / Reward . Often times , traders or investors will combine options using a spread strategy , buying one or more options to sell one or more different options . Spreading will offset the premium paid because the sold option premium will net against the options premium purchased . Moreover , the risk and return profiles of a spread will cap out the potential profit or loss . Spreads can be created to take advantage of nearly any anticipated price action , and can range from the simple to the complex . As with individual options , any spread strategy can be either bought or sold .
--------------------------
Reasons to Trade Options . Investors and traders undertake option trading either to hedge open positions ( for example , buying puts to hedge a long position , or buying calls to hedge a short position ) or to speculate on likely price movements of an underlying asset .
--------------------------
Reasons to Trade Options . The biggest benefit of using options is that of leverage . For example , say an investor has $ 900 to use on a particular trade and desires the most bang - for - the - buck . The investor is bullish in the short term on XYZ Inc. So , assume XYZ is trading at $ 90 . Our investor can buy a maximum of 10 shares of XYZ . However , XYZ also has three - month calls available with a strike price of $ 95 for a cost $ 3 . Now , instead of buying the shares , the investor buys three call option contracts . Buying three call options will cost $ 900 ( 3 contracts x 100 shares x $ 3 ) .
--------------------------
Reasons to Trade Options . Shortly before the call options expire , suppose XYZ is trading at $ 103 and the calls are trading at $ 8 , at which point the investor sells the calls . Here ’s how the return on investment stacks up in each case .
--------------------------
Reasons to Trade Options . Of course , the risk with buying the calls rather than the shares is that if XYZ had not traded above $ 95 by option expiration , the calls would have expired worthless and all $ 900 would be lost . In fact , XYZ had to trade at $ 98 ( $ 95 strike price + $ 3 premium paid ) , or about 9 % higher from its price when the calls were purchased , for the trade just to breakeven . When the broker 's cost to place the trade is also added to the equation , to be profitable , the stock would need to trade even higher .
--------------------------
Reasons to Trade Options . These scenarios assume that the trader held till expiration . That is not required with American options . At any time before expiry , the trader could have sold the option to lock in a profit . Or , if it looked the stock was not going to move above the strike price , they could sell the option for its remaining time value in order to reduce the loss . For example , the trader paid $ 3 for the options , but as time passes , if the stock price remains below the strike price , those options may drop to $ 1 . The trader could sell the three contracts for $ 1 , receiving $ 300 of the original $ 900 back and avoiding a total loss .
--------------------------
Reasons to Trade Options . The investor could also choose to exercise the call options rather than selling them to book profits / losses , but exercising the calls would require the investor to come up with a substantial sum of money to buy the number of shares their contracts represent . In the case above , that would require buying 300 shares at $ 95 .
--------------------------
Selecting the Right Option . Here are some broad guidelines that should help you decide which types of options to trade .
--------------------------
Selecting the Right Option . Are you bullish or bearish on the stock , sector , or the broad market that you wish to trade ? If so , are you rampantly , moderately , or just a tad bullish / bearish ? Making this determination will help you decide which option strategy to use , what strike price to use and what expiration to go for . Let ’s say you are rampantly bullish on hypothetical stock ZYX , a technology stock that is trading at $ 46 .
--------------------------
Selecting the Right Option . Is the market calm or quite volatile ? How about Stock ZYX ? If the implied volatility for ZYX is not very high ( say 20 % ) , then it may be a good idea to buy calls on the stock , since such calls could be relatively cheap .
--------------------------
Selecting the Right Option . As you are rampantly bullish on ZYX , you should be comfortable with buying out of the money calls . Assume you do not want to spend more than $ 0.50 per call option , and have a choice of going for two - month calls with a strike price of $ 49 available for $ 0.50 , or three - month calls with a strike price of $ 50 available for $ 0.47 . You decide to go with the latter since you believe the slightly higher strike price is more than offset by the extra month to expiration .
--------------------------
Selecting the Right Option . What if you were only slightly bullish on ZYX , and its implied volatility of 45 % was three times that of the overall market ? In this case , you could consider writing near - term puts to capture premium income , rather than buying calls as in the earlier instance .
--------------------------
Option Trading Tips . As an option buyer , your objective should be to purchase options with the longest possible expiration , in order to give your trade time to work out . Conversely , when you are writing options , go for the shortest possible expiration in order to limit your liability .
--------------------------
Option Trading Tips . Trying to balance the point above , when buying options , purchasing the cheapest possible ones may improve your chances of a profitable trade . Implied volatility of such cheap options is likely to be quite low , and while this suggests that the odds of a successful trade are minimal , it is possible that implied volatility and hence the option are underpriced . So , if the trade does work out , the potential profit can be huge . Buying options with a lower level of implied volatility may be preferable to buying those with a very high level of implied volatility , because of the risk of a higher loss ( higher premium paid ) if the trade does not work out .
--------------------------
Option Trading Tips . There is a trade - off between strike prices and options expirations , as the earlier example demonstrated . An analysis of support and resistance levels , as well as key upcoming events ( such as an earnings release ) , is useful in determining which strike price and expiration to use .
--------------------------
Option Trading Tips . Understand the sector to which the stock belongs . For example , biotech stocks often trade with binary outcomes when clinical trial results of a major drug are announced . Deeply out of the money calls or puts can be purchased to trade on these outcomes , depending on whether one is bullish or bearish on the stock . Obviously , it would be extremely risky to write calls or puts on biotech stocks around such events , unless the level of implied volatility is so high that the premium income earned compensates for this risk . By the same token , it makes little sense to buy deeply out of the money calls or puts on low - volatility sectors like utilities and telecoms .
--------------------------
Option Trading Tips . Use options to trade one - off events such as corporate restructurings and spin - offs , and recurring events like earnings releases . Stocks can exhibit very volatile behavior around such events , giving the savvy options trader an opportunity to cash in . For instance , buying cheap out of the money calls prior to the earnings report on a stock that has been in a pronounced slump , can be a profitable strategy if it manages to beat lowered expectations and subsequently surges .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . Investors with a lower risk appetite should stick to basic strategies like call or put buying , while more advanced strategies like put writing and call writing should only be used by sophisticated investors with adequate risk tolerance . As option strategies can be tailored to match one ’s unique risk tolerance and return requirement , they provide many paths to profitability .
