BREAKING DOWN Creation Unit . Creation units are central to the process an exchange - traded fund issuer undergoes when providing new ETF shares to the market . ETF issuers work with ETF distributors to issue new shares in creation units to broker - dealers . Creation units can vary in size , with most containing between 25,000 and 600,000 ETF shares each .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Creation Unit . Creation units are sold to broker - dealers who can pay for the shares in various forms . Shares are valued at the fund ’s net asset value ( NAV ) . Exchange - traded fund issuers can negotiate with broker - dealers on the terms of the sale , typically receiving cash or in - kind shares for the transaction . In - kind shares are a common way to pay for the shares in a creation unit . In - kind share transactions require the buyer to assemble a portfolio of securities which are then transferred to the issuing company . Creation unit sales can generate profits and losses for the broker - dealer prior to exchange listing . Profits and losses can have tax implications . Thus , broker - dealers have considerable risks when buying new creation units .

Authorized Participants . Exchange - traded fund issuers use creation units for new share issuance through broker - dealers . They also have relationships with broker - dealer trading desks , which act as authorized participants . Authorized participants are unique to open - end ETFs and serve to monitor significant deviation from a fund ’s NAV in the trading market . Since ETFs trade actively throughout the day on financial market exchanges , they offer premiums and discounts to their accounting NAV . Authorized participants follow this market mechanism and help manage premium and discount to NAV trading .
