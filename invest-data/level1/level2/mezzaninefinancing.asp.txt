What Is Mezzanine Financing ? . Mezzanine financing is a hybrid of debt and equity financing that gives the lender the right to convert to an equity interest in the company in case of default , generally , after venture capital companies and other senior lenders are paid .
--------------------------
What Is Mezzanine Financing ? . Mezzanine debt has embedded equity instruments attached , often known as warrants , which increase the value of the subordinated debt and allow greater flexibility when dealing with bondholders . Mezzanine financing is frequently associated with acquisitions and buyouts , for which it may be used to prioritize new owners ahead of existing owners in case of bankruptcy .
--------------------------
How Mezzanine Financing Works . Mezzanine financing bridges the gap between debt and equity financing and is one of the highest - risk forms of debt . It is subordinate to pure equity but senior to pure debt . However , this means that it also offers some of the highest returns when compared to other debt types , as it often receives rates between 12 % and 20 % per year .
--------------------------
How Mezzanine Financing Works . Companies commonly seek mezzanine financing to support specific growth projects or acquisitions . The benefits for a company in obtaining mezzanine financing include the fact that the providers of mezzanine capital are often long - term investors in the company . This makes it easier to obtain other types of financing since traditional creditors generally view a company with long - term investors in a more favorable light and are therefore more likely to extend credit and favorable terms to that company .
--------------------------
How Mezzanine Financing Works . A number of characteristics are common in the structuring of mezzanine loans , such as :
--------------------------
The Pros and Cons of Mezzanine Financing . Mezzanine financing may result in lenders gaining equity in a business or warrants for purchasing equity at a later date . This may significantly increase an investor 's rate of return ( ROR ) . In addition , mezzanine financing providers receive contractually obligated interest payments monthly , quarterly or annually .
--------------------------
The Pros and Cons of Mezzanine Financing . Borrowers prefer mezzanine debt because the interest is tax - deductible . Also , mezzanine financing is more manageable than other debt structures because borrowers may figure their interest in the balance of the loan . If a borrower can not make a scheduled interest payment , some or all of the interest may be deferred . This option is typically unavailable for other types of debt . In addition , quickly expanding companies grow in value and restructure mezzanine financing into one senior loan at a lower interest rate , saving on interest costs in the long term .
--------------------------
The Pros and Cons of Mezzanine Financing . However , when securing mezzanine financing , owners sacrifice control and upside potential due to the loss of equity . Owners also pay more in interest the longer mezzanine financing is in place .
--------------------------
An Example of Mezzanine Financing . For example , Bank XYZ provides Company ABC , a maker of surgical devices , with $ 15 million in mezzanine financing . The funding replaced a higher interest $ 10 million credit line with more favorable terms . Company ABC gained more working capital to help bring additional products to the market and paid off a higher interest debt . Bank XYZ will collect 10 % a year in interest payments and will be able to convert to an equity stake if the company defaults .
