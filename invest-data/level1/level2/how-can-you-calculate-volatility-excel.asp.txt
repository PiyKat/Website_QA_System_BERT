How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . Although there are several ways to measure the volatility of a given security , analysts typically look at historical volatility . Historical volatility is a measure of past performance . Because it allows for a more long - term assessment of risk , historical volatility is widely used by analysts and traders in the creation of investing strategies .
--------------------------
How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . To calculate the volatility of a given security in Microsoft Excel , first determine the time frame for which the metric will be computed . A 10-day period is used for this example . Next , enter all the closing stock prices for that period into cells B2 through B12 in sequential order , with the newest price at the bottom . Note that you will need the data for 11 days to compute the returns for a 10-day period .

How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . In column C , calculate the interday returns by dividing each price by the closing price of the day before and subtracting one . For example , if McDonald 's ( MCD ) closed at $ 147.82 on the first day and at $ 149.50 on the second day , the return of the second day would be ( 149.50/147.82 ) - 1 , or .011 , indicating that the price on day two was 1.1 % higher than the price on day one .
--------------------------
How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . Volatility is inherently related to standard deviation , or the degree to which prices differ from their mean . In cell C13 , enter the formula " = STDEV.S(C3 : C12 ) " to compute the standard deviation for the period .
--------------------------
How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . As mentioned above , volatility and deviation are closely linked . This is evident in the types of technical indicators that investors use to chart a stock 's volatility , such as Bollinger Bands , which are based on a stock 's standard deviation and the simple moving average ( SMA ) . However , historical volatility is an annualized figure , so to convert the daily standard deviation calculated above into a usable metric , it must be multiplied by an annualization factor based on the period used . The annualization factor is the square root of however many periods exist in a year .
--------------------------
How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . The table below shows the volatility for McDonald 's within a 10-day period :
--------------------------
How Do You Calculate Volatility in Excel ? . The example above used daily closing prices , and there are 252 trading days per year , on average . Therefore , in cell C14 , enter the formula " = SQRT(252)*C13 " to convert the standard deviation for this 10-day period to annualized historical volatility .
--------------------------
Why Volatility Is Important to Investors . Volatility in a stock has a bad connotation , but many traders and investors seek out higher volatility investments in order to make higher profits . After all , if a stock or other security does not move , it has low volatility , but it also has a low potential to make capital gains . On the other hand , a stock or other security with a very high volatility level can have tremendous profit potential , but the risk of loss is quite high . Timing of any trades must be perfect , and even a correct market call could end up losing money if the security 's wide price swings trigger a stop - loss or margin call .
