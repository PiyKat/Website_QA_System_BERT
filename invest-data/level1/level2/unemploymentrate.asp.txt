What Is the Unemployment Rate ? . The unemployment rate is the share of the labor force that is jobless , expressed as a percentage . It is a lagging indicator , meaning that it generally rises or falls in the wake of changing economic conditions , rather than anticipating them . When the economy is in poor shape and jobs are scarce , the unemployment rate can be expected to rise . When the economy is growing at a healthy rate and jobs are relatively plentiful , it can be expected to fall .
--------------------------
What Is the Unemployment Rate ? . In the U.S. , the U-3 rate , which the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) releases as part of its monthly employment situation report , is the most commonly cited national rate . It is not the only metric available , however , and it receives criticism for giving the impression that the labor market is healthier than alternative measures would indicate . For this reason , some observers prefer to track the more comprehensive U-6 rate ( see below ) .
--------------------------
Calculating the Unemployment Rate . The official unemployment rate is known as U-3 . It defines unemployed people as those who are willing and available to work , and who have actively sought work within the past four weeks . Those with temporary , part - time , or full - time jobs are considered employed , as are those who perform at least 15 hours of unpaid family work .
--------------------------
Calculating the Unemployment Rate . To calculate the unemployment rate , the number of unemployed people is divided by the number of people in the labor force , which consists of all employed and unemployed people . The ratio is expressed as a percentage .
--------------------------
Calculating the Unemployment Rate . ﻿U-3 = UnemployedLabor Force×100\begin{aligned } & \text{U-3 } = \frac { \text{Unemployed } } { \text{Labor Force } } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-3 = Labor ForceUnemployed​×100​﻿
--------------------------
Calculating the Unemployment Rate . Many people who would like to work but can not ( due to a disability , for example ) , or have become discouraged after looking for work without success , are not considered unemployed under this system ; since they are not employed either , they are categorized as outside the labor force . Critics see this approach as painting an unjustifiably rosy picture of the labor force . U-3 is also criticized for making no distinction between those in temporary , part - time , and full - time jobs , even in cases where part - time or temporary workers would rather work full - time but can not due to labor market conditions .
--------------------------
Calculating the Unemployment Rate . The unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted to account for predictable variations , such as extra hiring during the holidays . The BLS also provides the unadjusted rate :
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . In response to concerns that the official rate does not fully convey the health of the labor market , the BLS publishes five alternative measures : U-1 , U-2 , U-4 , U-5 , and U-6 . Though these are often referred to as unemployment rates ( U-6 , in particular , is often called the " real " unemployment rate ) , U-3 is technically the only unemployment rate . The others are measures of " labor underutilization . "
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . People who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer , expressed as a percentage of the labor force .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . ﻿U-1 = Unemployed 15 + WeeksLabor Force×100\begin{aligned } & \text{U-1 } = \frac { \text{Unemployed 15 + Weeks } } { \text{Labor Force } } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-1 = Labor ForceUnemployed 15 + Weeks​×100​﻿
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . People who lost their jobs , or whose temporary jobs ended , as a percentage of the labor force .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . ﻿U-2 = Job LosersLabor Force×100\begin{aligned } & \text{U-2 } = \frac { \text{Job Losers } } { \text{Labor Force } } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-2 = Labor ForceJob Losers​×100​﻿
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . Unemployed people , plus discouraged workers , as a percentage of the labor force ( plus discouraged workers ) .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . ﻿U-4 = Unemployed+Discouraged WorkersLabor Force+Discouraged Workers×100\begin{aligned } & \text{U-4 } = \frac { \text{Unemployed } + \text{Discouraged Workers } } { \text{Labor Force } + \text{Discouraged Workers } } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-4 = Labor Force+Discouraged WorkersUnemployed+Discouraged Workers​×100​﻿
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . Discouraged workers are those who are available to work and would like a job , but have given up actively looking for one . This category includes people who feel they lack the necessary qualifications or education , who believe there is no work available in their field , or who feel they are too young or old to find work . Those who feel unable to find work due to discrimination also fall under this category . Note that the denominator — normally labor force — is adjusted to include discouraged workers , who are not technically part of the labor force .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . Unemployed people , plus those who are marginally attached to the labor force , as a percentage of the labor force ( plus the marginally attached ) .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . ﻿U-5 = Unemployed+Marginally AttachedLabor Force+Marginally Attached×100\begin{aligned } & \text{U-5 } = \frac { \text{Unemployed } + \text{Marginally Attached } } { \text{Labor Force } + \text{Marginally Attached } } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-5 = Labor Force+Marginally AttachedUnemployed+Marginally Attached​×100​﻿
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . People who are marginally attached to the labor force include discouraged workers and anyone else who would like a job and has looked for one in the past 12 months but have given up actively searching . As with U-4 , the denominator is expanded to include the marginally attached , who are not technically part of the labor force .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . Unemployed people , plus people who are marginally attached to the labor force , plus those who are employed part - time for economic reasons , as a percentage of the labor force ( plus marginally attached ) .
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . ﻿U-6 = Unemployed+MA+PTERLabor Force+MA×100where : MA = marginally attachedPTER = part - time for economic reasons\begin{aligned } & \text{U-6 } = \frac { \text{Unemployed } + \text{MA } + \text{PTER } } { \text{Labor Force } + \text{MA } } \times 100 \\ & \textbf{where : } \\ & \text{MA } = \text{marginally attached } \\ & \text{PTER } = \text{part - time for economic reasons } \\ \end{aligned}​U-6 = Labor Force+MAUnemployed+MA+PTER​×100where : MA = marginally attachedPTER = part - time for economic reasons​﻿
--------------------------
Alternative Measures . This metric is the BLS ' most comprehensive . In addition to the categories included in U-5 , it accounts for people who have been forced to settle for part - time work even though they want to work full - time . This category is often referred to as " underemployed , " although that label arguably includes full - time workers who are overqualified for their jobs . The denominator for this ratio is the same as in U-5 .
--------------------------
How Is Unemployment Data Collected ? . Official U.S. employment statistics are produced by the BLS , an agency within the Department of Labor . Every month the Census Bureau , part of the Department of Commerce , conducts the Current Population Survey using a sample of around 60,000 households , or around 110,000 individuals . The survey collects data on individuals in these households by race , ethnicity , age , veteran status , and gender , all of which — along with geography — add nuance to the employment data . The sample is rotated so that 75 % of the households are constant from month to month and 50 % are from year to year . Interviews are conducted in - person or by phone .
--------------------------
How Is Unemployment Data Collected ? . The survey excludes individuals under the age of 16 and those who are in the Armed Forces ( hence references to the " civilian labor force " ) . People in correctional facilities , mental healthcare facilities , and other similar institutions are also excluded . Interviewers ask a series of questions that determine employment status , but do not ask whether respondents are employed or unemployed . Nor do the interviewers themselves assign employment status ; they record the answers for the BLS to analyze . Interviewers also collect information on industry , occupation , average earnings , union membership and — for the jobless — whether they quit or were discharged ( fired or laid off ) .
--------------------------
Where to Find the Unemployment Rate . The unemployment rate is reported on the first Friday of every month for the preceding month . The current report and past editions are available via the BLS ' website . Users can generate and download tables showing any of the labor market measures named above for a specified date range .
