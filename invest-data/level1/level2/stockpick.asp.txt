What is a Stock Pick ? . A stock pick is when an analyst or investor uses a systematic form of analysis to conclude that a particular stock will make a good investment and , therefore , should be added to his or her portfolio . This is also known as active management . The position can be either long or short and will depend on the analyst or investor 's outlook for the particular stock 's price .
--------------------------
Understanding Stock Picking . Stock picking can be a very difficult process because there is never a foolproof way to determine what a stock 's price will do in the future . However , by examining numerous factors , an investor may be able to get a better sense of future stock prices than by relying on guesswork . Since forecasting is not an exact science , an investor or analyst who uses any forecasting technique should include a margin of error in the calculations .
--------------------------
Understanding Stock Picking . Active management utilizes teams of analysts who pick stocks for investment . These active management ETFs , mutual funds or separate accounts , can utilize a bottom - up or top - down strategy to pick stocks . It is common for a fund company to offer a " high conviction " fund which includes a small number of stocks that analysts have picked as their best high - performance bets for the next several years . Usually , these high conviction funds hold 20 - 40 stocks . This is much a much smaller number than the average actively managed fund , and certainly a small number than a fund that tracks an index .
--------------------------
Understanding Stock Picking . Active management ( stock picking ) can be contrasted with passive management , where there are no teams of analysts picking individual stocks . The investor that buys a passively managed ETF or mutual fund will automatically be invested in the underlying basket of stocks that ETF or mutual fund invests in . These baskets of stocks are usually based on an index , such as the S&P 500 Index , or a sector , such as health care .
--------------------------
Example of a Stock Pick . Jay is an investment analyst with a firm and he is focused on the tech sector . Jay picks the stock of company ABC , which is a social media network , as his pick after careful analysis . He considers a number of factors while analyzing ABC 's stock . These include the company 's revenues and profits during the previous year and the current regulatory climate for tech companies across various jurisdictions .
--------------------------
Example of a Stock Pick . He notes that ABC is in hot water in some of the geographies it operates in but that those problems will not have a significant impact on its bottom line . ABC has also diversified away from its core product to include offerings that span a range of emerging technologies . As a result , even if the company loses market share in social media , it has other sources of revenue to mitigate those losses .
