What is a Product Recall . A product recall is the process of retrieving defective and/or potentially unsafe goods from consumers while providing those consumers with compensation . Recalls often occur as a result of safety concerns over a manufacturing defect in a product that may harm its user .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Product Recall . While the process behind a recall can vary depending on local laws , there are some general steps that occur . For example , if a pet food manufacturer releases a batch of product that contains an ingredient that may accidentally poison animals , the company will publicly announce the dangers of the food and request that its customers return the product to the firm , or simply discard it . Customers will usually be given a full refund or replacement . A public relations campaign is often created to handle the publicity surrounding the event .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Product Recall . Recalls may negatively affect a company 's stock . Concerns grow over a company 's capabilities when a dangerous product is released , and customers may turn away from purchasing its goods in the future , leading to declining sales .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Product Recall . Some recalls may ban the sale of an item , while others may ask consumers to voluntarily return a defective item for replacement or repair . In certain examples , such as an automobile recall , a seller may provide a new part or perform a diagnostic that reduces the danger of using the product .
--------------------------
Examples of Product Recalls . Tens of millions of vehicles have already been recalled in recent years over concerns that the installed Takata air bags are defective . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) says that long - term exposure to high heat and humidity can cause these air bags to explode when deployed . This particular recall includes the phasing and prioritizing of repairs , as all of the replacement parts could not be made available right away and certain vehicles were at much higher risk of a dangerous air bag explosion than others .
--------------------------
Examples of Product Recalls . Back in 2009 , a major salmonella outbreak from peanut butter products processed by Peanut Corp. of America reportedly killed a number of people and sickened hundreds more . Thousands of products containing potentially - tainted peanut butter sold by a large number of different companies were associated with the massive recall . Peanut Corp. went out of business shortly afterward , and the industry took a major hit as a result .
--------------------------
Examples of Product Recalls . Later , several toy makers , including Mattel and Fisher - Price , were forced to recall millions of their children 's toys back in the mid-2000s due to excessive amounts of lead in the paint of the products . These unsafe toys had been primarily manufactured in Chinese factories .
