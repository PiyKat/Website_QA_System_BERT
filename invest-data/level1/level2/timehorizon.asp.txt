What is an Investment Time Horizon ? . An Investment Time Horizon , or just Time Horizon , is the period of time one expects to hold an investment until they need the money back . Time horizons are largely dictated by investment goals and strategies . For example , saving for a down payment on a house , maybe 2 years , would be considered a short - term time horizon , while saving for college a medium - term time horizon , and investing for retirement a long - term time horizon .

The Basics of Investment Time Horizons . An Investment Time Horizon is the period where one expects to hold an investment for a specific goal . Investments are generally broken down into two main categories : stocks ( riskier ) and bonds ( less risky ) . The longer the Time Horizon , the more aggressive , or riskier portfolio , an investor can build . The shorter the Time Horizon , the more conservative , or less risky , the investor may want to adopt .

An Example of an Investment Time Horizon . Let ’s say two people marry , and while they live in the city now , they ’d eventually like to move out to the ‘ burbs in a few years . But they do n’t have the money for a down payment , so they ’ll need to start saving up . That ’s a short - term investment horizon , so they ’ll probably want to go with something relatively conservative , like a money market fund , to avoid any sharp swings in stocks . Meanwhile , they ’ve both taken advantage of their employer ’s 401k savings fund ( an employer sponsored retirement fund , sometimes with employer matching ! ) And since they ’re both young , that ’s a long - term Time Horizon . Given the length of time until their retirement , they can afford to be very aggressive in their asset allocation , upwards of 90 % stocks , as the long Investment Horizon should allow their portfolio to recover from any short - term downturns . Next a baby comes along ! Now they have to start thinking about saving for college . That ’s more of a medium / long - term goal , so they can be pretty aggressive in the beginning and then turn a little more conservative as high school graduation comes along . But there is a government saving plan ( 529 ) which allows your contributions to grow tax free , as long as they ’re used for educational expenses .
