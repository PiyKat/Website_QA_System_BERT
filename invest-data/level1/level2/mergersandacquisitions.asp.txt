What Are Mergers and Acquisitions – M&A ? . Mergers and acquisitions ( M&A ) is a general term used to describe the consolidation of companies or assets through various types of financial transactions , including mergers , acquisitions , consolidations , tender offers , purchase of assets and management acquisitions . The term M&A also refers to the desks at financial institutions that deal in such activity .
--------------------------
The Essence of Merger . The terms " mergers " and " acquisitions " are often used interchangeably , although in actuality , they hold slightly different meanings . When one company takes over another entity , and establishes itself as the new owner , the purchase is called an acquisition . From a legal point of view , the target company ceases to exist , the buyer absorbs the business , and the buyer 's stock continues to be traded , while the target company ’s stock ceases to trade .
--------------------------
The Essence of Merger . On the other hand , a merger describes two firms of approximately the same size , who join forces to move forward as a single new entity , rather than remain separately owned and operated . This action is known as a " merger of equals . " Both companies ' stocks are surrendered and new company stock is issued in its place . Case in point : both Daimler - Benz and Chrysler ceased to exist when the two firms merged , and a new company , Daimler Chrysler , was created . A purchase deal will also be called a merger when both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies .
--------------------------
The Action of Acquisition . Unfriendly deals , where target companies do not wish to be purchased , are always regarded as acquisitions . Therefore , a purchasing deal is classified as a merger or an acquisition , based on whether the purchase is friendly or hostile and how it is announced . In other words , the difference lies in how the deal is communicated to the target company 's board of directors , employees and shareholders . Nestle , for instance , has performed a variety of acquisitions lately .
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . Here is a list of transactions that fall under the M&A umbrella :
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . In a merger , the boards of directors for two companies approve the combination and seek shareholders ' approval . Post merger , the acquired company ceases to exist and becomes part of the acquiring company . For example , in 2007 a merger deal occurred between Digital Computers and Compaq , whereby Compaq absorbed Digital Computers .
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . In a simple acquisition , the acquiring company obtains the majority stake in the acquired firm , which does not change its name or alter its legal structure . An example of this transaction is Manulife Financial Corporation 's 2004 acquisition of John Hancock Financial Services , where both companies preserved their names and organizational structures .
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . Consolidation creates a new company . Stockholders of both companies must approve the consolidation . Subsequent to the approval , they receive common equity shares in the new firm . For example , in 1998 , Citicorp and Traveler 's Insurance Group announced a consolidation , which resulted in Citigroup .
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . In a tender offer , one company offers to purchase the outstanding stock of the other firm , at a specific price . The acquiring company communicates the offer directly to the other company 's shareholders , bypassing the management and board of directors . For example , in 2008 , Johnson & Johnson made a tender offer to acquire Omrix Biopharmaceuticals for $ 438 million . While the acquiring company may continue to exist — especially if there are certain dissenting shareholders — most tender offers result in mergers .
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . In an acquisition of assets , one company acquires the assets of another company . The company whose assets are being acquired must obtain approval from its shareholders . The purchase of assets is typical during bankruptcy proceedings , where other companies bid for various assets of the bankrupt company , which is liquidated upon the final transfer of assets to the acquiring firms .
--------------------------
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . In a management acquisition , also known as a management - led buyout ( MBO ) , a company 's executives purchase a controlling stake in another company , making it private . These former executives often partner with a financier or former corporate officers , in an effort to help fund a transaction . Such M&A transactions are typically financed disproportionately with debt , and the majority of shareholders must approve it . For example , in 2013 , Dell Corporation announced that it was acquired by its chief executive manager , Michael Dell .
--------------------------
The Structure of Mergers . Mergers may be structured in multiple different ways , based on the relationship between the two companies involved in the deal .
--------------------------
The Structure of Mergers . Mergers may also be distinguished by following two financing methods -- each with its own ramifications for investors .
--------------------------
Details of Acquisitions . Like some merger deals , in acquisitions , a company may buy another company with cash , stock or a combination of the two . And in smaller deals , it is common for one company to acquire all of another company 's assets . Company X buys all of Company Y 's assets for cash , which means that Company Y will have only cash ( and debt , if any ) . Of course , Company Y becomes merely a shell and will eventually liquidate or enter other areas of business .
--------------------------
Details of Acquisitions . Another acquisition deal known as a " reverse merger " enables a private company to become publicly - listed in a relatively short time period . Reverse mergers occur when a private company that has strong prospects and is eager to acquire financing buys a publicly - listed shell company , with no legitimate business operations and limited assets . The private company reverses merges into the public company , and together they become an entirely new public corporation with tradeable shares .
--------------------------
Valuation Matters . Both companies involved on either side of an M&A deal will value the target company differently . The seller will obviously value the company at the highest price as possible , while the buyer will attempt to buy it for the lowest possible price . Fortunately , a company can be objectively valued by studying comparable companies in an industry , and by relying on the following metrics :
