What is a Cash Settlement ? . A cash settlement is a settlement method used in certain futures and options contracts where , upon expiration or exercise , the seller of the financial instrument does not deliver the actual ( physical ) underlying asset but instead transfers the associated cash position . For sellers not wishing to take actual possession of the underlying cash commodity , a cash settlement is a more convenient method of transacting futures and options contracts . Cash - settled contracts are one of the main reasons for the entry of speculators and , consequently , more liquidity in derivatives markets .

What is a Cash Settlement ? . For example , the purchaser of a cash - settled cotton futures contract is required to pay the difference between the spot price of cotton and the futures price , rather than having to take ownership of physical bundles of cotton . This is in contrast to physical settlement , where delivery of the actual underlying instrument(s ) does take place .

What is a Cash Settlement ? . Most financial derivatives based on market indexes , such as options or futures based on the S&P 500 or Russell 2000 indexes , are cash - settled . On the other hand , listed equity options contracts are often settled by delivery of the actual underlying shares of stock .
--------------------------
What is a Cash Settlement ? . Cash settlement can become an issue at expiration because without the delivery of the actual underlying assets , any hedges in place before expiration will not be offset - this means that a trader must be diligent to close out hedges or roll over expiring derivatives positions in order to replicate the expiring positions . This issue does not occur with physical delivery .
--------------------------
Basics of Cash Settlement . Futures and options contracts are derivative instruments that have values based on an underlying asset . The asset can be an equity or a commodity . When a futures contract or options contract is expired or exercised , the conceptual recourse is for the holder of the contract to deliver the physical commodity or transfer the actual shares of stock . This is known as physical delivery and is much more cumbersome than a cash settlement .

Basics of Cash Settlement . If an investor goes short on a futures contract for $ 10,000 worth of silver , for example , it is inconvenient at the end of the contract for the holder to physically deliver the silver to another investor . To circumvent this , futures and options contracts can be conducted with a cash settlement , where , at the end of the contract , the holder of the position is either credited or debited the difference between the initial price and the final settlement . This is also very true among traders and speculators in agricultural futures and options markets who trade things like cattle and other livestock . These traders are not farmers or meat processors and only care about the market price . So , they do not wish to take delivery of a herd of live animals .
--------------------------
Basics of Cash Settlement . There are a couple of advantages to cash settlements . First , they reduce overall time and costs required during a contract 's finalization . Cash - settled contracts are relatively simple to deliver because they require only transfer of money . An actual physical delivery has additional costs tacked onto it , such as transportation costs and costs associated with ensuring delivery quality and verification . Second , cash - settled accounts are also safeguards against a default . This is because cash settlement requires margin accounts , which are monitored daily , to ensure that they have the required balances to conduct a trade .

Key Takeaways .
--------------------------
An Example of a Cash Settlement . Futures contracts are taken out by investors who believe a commodity will increase or decrease in price in the future . If an investor goes short a futures contract for wheat , he is assuming the price of wheat will decrease in the short term . A contract is initiated with another investor who takes the other side of the coin , believing wheat will increase in price .
--------------------------
An Example of a Cash Settlement . An investor goes short on a futures contract for 100 bushels of wheat for a total of $ 10,000 . This means at the end of the contract , if the price of 100 bushels of wheat drops to $ 8,000 , the investor is set to earn $ 2,000 . However , if the price of 100 bushels of wheat increases to $ 12,000 , the investor loses $ 2,000 . Conceptually , at the end of the contract , the 100 bushels of wheat are " delivered " to the investor with the long position . However , to make things easier , a cash settlement can be used . If the price increases to $ 12,000 , the short investor is required to pay the difference of $ 12,000 - $ 10,000 , or $ 2,000 , rather than actually delivering the wheat . Conversely , if the price decreases to $ 8,000 , the investor is paid $ 2,000 by the long position .
