What Is a Sample ? . A sample refers to a smaller , manageable version of a larger group . It is a subset containing the characteristics of a larger population . Samples are used in statistical testing when population sizes are too large for the test to include all possible members or observations . A sample should represent the population as a whole and not reflect any bias toward a specific attribute .
--------------------------
Understanding Samples . A sample is an unbiased number of observations taken from a population . In basic terms , a population is the total number of individuals , animals , items , observation , data , etc . of any given subject . So the sample , in other words , is a portion , part , or fraction of the whole group , and acts as a subset of the population . Samples are used in a variety of settings where research is conducted . Scientists , marketers , government agencies , economists , and research groups are among those who use samples for their studies and measurements .
--------------------------
Understanding Samples . Using whole populations for research comes with challenges , which is why samples are used . Researchers may have problems gaining ready access to entire populations . And because of the nature of some studies , researchers may have difficulties getting the results they need in a timely fashion . This is why people who conduct studies use samples . Using a smaller number of people who represent the entire population can still produce valid results while cutting back on time and resources .
--------------------------
Understanding Samples . Samples used by researchers should closely resemble the population . All the participants in the sample should share the same characteristics and qualities . So , if the study is about male college freshmen , the sample should be a small percentage of males that fit this description . Similarly , if a research group conducts a study on the sleep patterns of single women over 50 , the sample should only include women within this demographic .
--------------------------
Understanding Samples . Consider a team of academic researchers who want to know how many students studied for less than 40 hours for the CFA exam and still passed . Since more than 200,000 people take the exam globally each year , reaching out to each and every exam participant may be extremely tedious and time - consuming . In fact , by the time the data from the population has been collected and analyzed , a couple of years would have passed , making the analysis worthless since a new population would have emerged . What the researchers can do instead is take a sample of the population and get data from this sample .
--------------------------
. To get an unbiased sample , the selection must be random so everyone in the population has an equal chance of being added to the group .
--------------------------
. In order to achieve an unbiased sample , the selection has to be random so everyone from the population has an equal and likely chance of being added to the sample group . This is similar to a lottery draw and is the basis for simple random sampling .
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . Simple random sampling is ideal if every entity in the population is identical . If the researchers do n’t care whether their sample subjects are all male or all female or a combination of both sexes in some form , the simple random sampling may be a good selection technique .
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . Let 's say there were 200,000 test - takers who sat for the CFA exam in 2016 , out of which 40 % were women and 60 % were men . The random sample drawn from the population should , therefore , have 400 women and 600 men for a total of 1,000 test - takers .
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . But what about cases where knowing the ratio of men to women that passed a test after studying for less than 40 hours is important ? Here , a stratified random sample would be preferable to a simple random sample .
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . This type of sampling , also referred to as proportional random sampling or quota random sampling , divides the overall population into smaller groups . These are known as strata . People within the strata share similar characteristics .
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . What if age was an important factor that researchers would like to include in their data ? Using the stratified random sampling technique , they could create layers or strata for each age group . The selection from each strata would have to be random so that everyone in the bracket has a likely chance of being included in the sample . For example , two participants , Alex and David , are 22 and 24 years old , respectively . The sample selection can not pick one over the other based on some preferential mechanism . They both should have an equal chance of being selected from their age group . The strata could look something like this :
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . From the table , the population has been divided into age groups . For example , 30,000 people within the age range of 20 to 24 years old took the CFA exam in 2016 . Using this same proportion , the sample group will have ( 30,000 ÷ 200,000 ) x 1,000 = 150 test - takers that fall within this group . Alex or David — or both or neither — may be included among the 150 random exam participants of the sample .
--------------------------
Types of Sampling . There are many more strata that could be compiled when deciding on a sample size . Some researchers might populate the job functions , countries , marital status , etc . of the test = takers when deciding how to create the sample .
--------------------------
Examples of Samples . As of 2017 , the population of the world was 7.5 billion , out of which 49.6 % were female and 50.4 % were male . The total number of people in any given country can also be a population size . The total number of students in a city can be taken as a population , and the total number of dogs in a city is also a population size . Samples can be taken from these populations for research purposes .
--------------------------
Examples of Samples . Following our CFA exam example , the researchers could take a sample of 1,000 CFA participants from the total 200,000 test - takers — the population — and run the required data on this number . The mean of this sample would be taken to estimate the average of CFA exam takers that passed even though they only studied for less than 40 hours .
--------------------------
Examples of Samples . The sample group taken should not be biased . This means that if the sample mean of the 1,000 CFA exam participants is 50 , the population mean of the 200,000 test - takers should also be approximately 50 .
