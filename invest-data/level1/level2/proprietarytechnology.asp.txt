What Is Proprietary Technology ? . Proprietary technology is any combination of processes , tools , or systems of interrelated connections that are the property of a business or individual . These combinations provide a benefit or competitive advantage to the owners of proprietary technologies .
--------------------------
What Is Proprietary Technology ? . Companies capable of developing useful proprietary technologies in - house are rewarded with a valuable asset and can either use it exclusively or profit from the sale of licensing their technology to other parties .
--------------------------
What Is Proprietary Technology ? . Access to valuable proprietary technologies can also be purchased . This option , however , is often costlier and comes with greater restrictions on the use of underlying technologies .
--------------------------
Understanding Proprietary Technology . Proprietary technology involves an application , tool , or system that belongs exclusively to an enterprise . These are generally developed and used by the owner internally in order to produce and sell products or services to the end user or customer . In other cases , they may be provided to an end - user or customer for a cost .
--------------------------
Understanding Proprietary Technology . In some industries , proprietary technologies are a key determinant of success . As a result , they are confidential . Being carefully guarded within a corporation , they are protected legally by patents and copyrights . For many businesses , particularly in knowledge - based industries , intellectual property can make up a majority of assets on an entity ’s balance sheet . For these businesses , investors and interested parties go to great lengths to assess and value proprietary technologies and their contribution to business results .
--------------------------
. One of the first steps a business can take to protect its proprietary technology is to understand how valuable an asset it is .
--------------------------
. Because research and development ( R&D ) expenses are something of a silent key to success , many businesses do not freely give away hints to what they ’re working on behind the scenes . Analysts and investors try to uncover undisclosed breakthroughs in corporate proprietary technologies so they can take advantage of proprietary investment accounts as well .
--------------------------
Types of Proprietary Technology . Proprietary technology takes many forms and depends on the nature of the business that owns it . It can be both a physical and an intangible asset developed and used by the organization .
--------------------------
Types of Proprietary Technology . For example , a company may own its own data system . For example , financial institutions develop their own internal systems to collect and process data that is used internally . These systems can be found in a bank branch , where employees input information when customers come in to do routine banking at the teller line .
--------------------------
Types of Proprietary Technology . Companies may also develop their own software . Proprietary software is the opposite of free software , which has no limitations on who uses it . Its ownership is restricted to the publisher or distributor . Certain conditions must be met before the owner allows an end - user access to the software . For example , a tax preparation company may charge customers a fee to use their software to complete their tax returns .
--------------------------
Examples of Proprietary Technology . While the advantages of some proprietary technologies are clear , others are not so evident . And it 's only through recombination with other technologies where the true value is uncovered — an effort now simply known as innovation .
--------------------------
Examples of Proprietary Technology . The story of Xerox and Apple ’s Steve Jobs is a classic example . Not knowing what they had on their hands in the late 1970s , Xerox essentially gave away the idea behind a computer mouse to Jobs who went on to use the technology in Apple ’s early computer designs .
--------------------------
Examples of Proprietary Technology . Proprietary technology is also a big part of the biotech industry . Let 's say a company in this industry successfully develops a new drug to treat a major disease . By patenting the process , method , and the end result of the drug , the company can reap substantial rewards from its efforts to develop its proprietary technology .
--------------------------
Protecting Proprietary Technology . Companies go to great lengths to keep their proprietary technology protected . After all , organizations spend a lot of time , effort , and money on developing the know - how for their products and services . Not taking the time to protect their interests could spell disaster for their operations .
--------------------------
Protecting Proprietary Technology . Because it 's so valuable , proprietary technology is always at risk . As mentioned above , companies can protect themselves by taking out patents and copyrights on their proprietary technology . These give the owner rights to the intellectual property and prevent others from copying the innovations .
--------------------------
Protecting Proprietary Technology . Employees may leak or share it with others including the competition — accidentally or intentionally — or a data breach may occur , exposing trade secrets to hackers . So how do companies safeguard themselves from these unforeseeable actions ?
--------------------------
Protecting Proprietary Technology . Many corporations control and/or limit employee access to data . Employees may also be required to sign non - disclosure agreements ( NDAs ) , a contract that gives the employer legal recourse if internal , confidential information is shared with outside parties . Companies may also need to continuously update their security systems to ensure there is no data breach , exposing their secrets to third parties .
