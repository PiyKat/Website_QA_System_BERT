Tech Bubble . Tech bubble refers to a pronounced and unsustainable market rise attributed to increased speculation in technology stocks . Rapid share price growth and high valuations based on standard metrics , such as price / earnings ratio or price / sales , normally characterize a tech bubble .
--------------------------
Understanding Tech Bubbles . As a general rule of thumb , bubbles form when excess capital , usually at the latter stages of a credit cycle , is desperate in its search for alpha in saturated markets . While value will be created , the vast majority of the initial public offerings ( IPO ) will fail . The tech bubble is often cited as a prime example when depicting the characteristics of bubble behavior .
--------------------------
Understanding Tech Bubbles . Technology stocks involved in a bubble may be confined to a particular industry ( such as internet software or fuel cells ) , or cover the entire technology sector as a whole , depending on the strength and depth of investor demand . At the peak of a bubble , many fledgling tech companies seek to go public through IPOs in an attempt to capitalize on heightened investor demand .

Key Takeaways . During the formation of a tech bubble , investors begin to collectively think that there 's a tremendous opportunity to be had , or that it 's a unique time in the markets . This leads them to purchase stocks at overinflated prices . New metrics are often used to justify these stock prices , while fundamentals , as a whole , tend to take a backseat to rosy forecasts and blind speculation .

Key Takeaways . Most bubbles end with a crash once investors awaken to the implausibility of the heightened expectations being met , and rush to the exits . Some bubbles might simply deflate as investors slowly lose interest and sales pressure pushes stock valuations back to normalized levels . The dotcom tech bubble , like most bubbles , ended with a crash once investors awoke to the reality that heightened expectations would not be met and rushed to exit en masse .
--------------------------
The Dotcom Tech Bubble . The dotcom tech bubble occurred in the late 1990s and ended abruptly in early 2000 . The causes for its downfall are numerous , but evidence of this decline first appeared within the big telecom hardware providers , who at the time were supplying most of the tech startups and dotcoms with servers and networking hardware . Once revenue at the telecoms reduced dramatically , it rippled through their respective end markets and , eventually , the entire economy slipped into recession in 2001 .

The Bitcoin Tech Bubble . The rise of Bitcoin from just over $ 10 in 2013 to $ 20,000 in late 2017 has been one of the largest tech bubbles of all time . The cryptocurrency surged roughly 2,000 % in 2017 before surrendering half of those gains in early 2018 . The technology behind Bitcoin , called blockchain , is fueling tech startups to raise money through initial coin offerings ( ICOs ) to fund their projects . Investors receive tokens or coins in return that can be used on a startup â€™s platform or traded for speculative purposes on decentralized exchanges . In late 2017 and early 2018 , many speculative cryptocurrencies were listing at a significant premium to their ICO price , similar to up - and - coming internet stocks at the height of the dotcom tech bubble .
