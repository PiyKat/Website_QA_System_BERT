Credit Agency . A credit agency is a for - profit company that collects information about individuals ' and businesses ' debts and assigns a numerical value called a credit score that indicates the borrower 's creditworthiness .

Credit Agency . Creditors and lenders , such as credit card companies and banks , report their customers ' borrowing activity and history to credit agencies . Individuals and businesses can obtain copies of the information reported about them by contacting the credit agency or a related third - party company and paying a nominal fee .

Breaking Down Credit Agency . The information provided to credit agencies includes how much credit is available to that borrower , how much of the available credit they have used , and what their repayment activity looks like . Credit agencies , also known as credit rating agencies , help potential lenders and creditors determine whether to lend or extend credit to an individual or business , by predicting the likelihood that the borrower will repay the debt in a timely manner .

Ways Credit Agencies Affect Financial Transactions . The assessments and ratings provided by credit agencies can effect financing - driven purchases and activities such as buying a car or securing a mortgage to acquire real estate . Conversely , the repayment of tuition loans for college students may affect the ratings assigned by credit agencies .

Ways Credit Agencies Affect Financial Transactions . Three consumer credit agencies are TransUnion , Equifax , and Experian . There can be variances in the ratings assigned by the agencies for the same individual . These differences may stem from different businesses and lenders reporting financial information about borrowing and repayment activity to some agencies , but not to all three .

Ways Credit Agencies Affect Financial Transactions . The scores and credit reports that are generated by these agencies may be used for other purposes outside of loan approval . For instance , certain employers might request the credit rating of potential hires when considering job candidates . This may be due to the nature of the position , which could require a high sense of fiscal responsibility .
--------------------------
Ways Credit Agencies Affect Financial Transactions . Businesses can likewise be assessed by credit agencies , not only for their financial fitness to repay financing they apply for , but also for the sake of potential investors in the business . As part of a due diligence process before a deal , the credit score of the business will likely be examined by the party that wishes to engage in a financial transaction . For example , a potential buyer who wants to acquire a business may want to understand its financial health before it secures the deal . Likewise , potential backers in a funding round or prospective buyers for a public offering from the company may require a report from a credit agency before advancing their plans .
