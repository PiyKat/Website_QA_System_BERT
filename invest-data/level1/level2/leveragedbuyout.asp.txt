What Is a Leveraged Buyout ? . A leveraged buyout ( LBO ) is the acquisition of another company using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the cost of acquisition . The assets of the company being acquired are often used as collateral for the loans , along with the assets of the acquiring company .
--------------------------
. The purpose of leveraged buyouts is to allow companies to make large acquisitions without having to commit a lot of capital .
--------------------------
Understanding Leveraged Buyout ( LBO ) . In a leveraged buyout ( LBO ) , there is usually a ratio of 90 % debt to 10 % equity . Because of this high debt / equity ratio , the bonds issued in the buyout are usually are not investment grade and are referred to as junk bonds . Further , many people regard LBOs as an especially ruthless , predatory tactic . This is because it is n't usually sanctioned by the target company . It is also seen as ironic in that a company 's success , in terms of assets on the balance sheet , can be used against it as collateral by a hostile company .
--------------------------
Understanding Leveraged Buyout ( LBO ) . LBOs are conducted for three main reasons . The first is to take a public company private ; the second is to spin - off a portion of an existing business by selling it ; and the third is to transfer private property , as is the case with a change in small business ownership . However , it is usually a requirement that the acquired company or entity , in each scenario , is profitable and growing .
--------------------------
An Example of Leveraged Buyouts ( LBO ) . Leveraged buyouts have had a notorious history , especially in the 1980s , when several prominent buyouts led to the eventual bankruptcy of the acquired companies . This was mainly due to the fact that the leverage ratio was nearly 100 % and the interest payments were so large that the company 's operating cash flows were unable to meet the obligation .
--------------------------
An Example of Leveraged Buyouts ( LBO ) . One of the largest LBOs on record was the acquisition of Hospital Corporation of America ( HCA ) by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. ( KKR ) , Bain & Co. , and Merrill Lynch in 2006 . The three companies paid around $ 33 billion for the acquisition of HCA .

An Example of Leveraged Buyouts ( LBO ) . LBOs are often complicated and take a while to complete . For example , JAB Holding Company , a private firm that invests in luxury goods , coffee and healthcare companies , initiated an LBO of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts , Inc. in May 2016 . JAB was slated to purchase the company for $ 1.5 billion , which included a $ 350 million leveraged loan and a $ 150 million revolving credit facility provided by the Barclays investment bank .
--------------------------
An Example of Leveraged Buyouts ( LBO ) . However , Krispy Kreme had debt on its balance sheet that needed to be sold , and Barclays was required to add an additional 0.5 % interest rate in order to make it more attractive . This made the LBO more complicated and it almost did n't close . However , as of July 12 , 2016 , the deal went through .
