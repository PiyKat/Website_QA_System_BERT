What Is Cumulative Return ? . A cumulative return on an investment is the aggregate amount that the investment has gained or lost over time , independent of the period of time involved . Presented as a percentage , the cumulative return is the raw mathematical return of the following calculation :

What Is Cumulative Return ? . ﻿(Current Price of Security)−(Original Price of Security)Original Price of Security\frac{(Current\ Price \ of \ Security ) - ( Original \ Price \ of \ Security)}{Original \ Price \ of \ Security}Original Price of Security(Current Price of Security)−(Original Price of Security)​﻿
--------------------------
How Cumulative Return Works . The cumulative return of a stock that does not have a dividend is easily calculated by figuring out the amount of profit or loss over the original price . For example , investing $ 10,000 in Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) for a 10-year period ending on Dec. 31 , 2018 , results in $ 48,922 . With no dividends reinvested , this is a total cumulative return of 697.99 % or an average of 10.94 % ; it also includes two stock splits . The value of dividends received during that time period also adds another $ 13,611 in profit above the original investment .
--------------------------
How Cumulative Return Works . Calculating the cumulative return for a stock that reinvests dividends is much more difficult . In the Johnson & Johnson example above , reinvesting the dividends nets a total value of $ 75,626 . Cumulative return could be misleading in this scenario because the reinvested aggregate amount is more than the previous example , where the total between the principal of $ 48,922 and dividends not invested of $ 13,611 is $ 62,533 .
--------------------------
How Cumulative Return Works . Reinvesting the dividends increases the investor ’s cost basis and reduces cumulative return . For the reinvested example , the stockholder ’s cumulative return is 656.26 % or an average of 10.64 % . When compared , the reinvested amount has a lower cumulative return but really yields more total dollar amount for the investor , with an additional $ 13,093 .
--------------------------
Cumulative Return and Mutual Funds . A common way to present the " effect " of a mutual fund 's performance over time is to show the cumulative return with a visual such as a mountain graph . Investors should check to confirm whether interest and/or dividends are included in the cumulative return ( the marketing materials or info accompanying an illustration should say ) ; such payouts may be assumed to be reinvested or simply counted as raw dollars when calculating the cumulative return .
--------------------------
Cumulative Return and Mutual Funds . One notable difference between mutual funds and stocks is mutual funds sometimes distribute capital gains to the fund holders . This distribution usually comes at the end of a calendar year and consists of the profits the portfolio managers made when closing out holdings . Mutual fund owners have the option to reinvest those capital gains , which can further make calculating the cumulative return more difficult .
--------------------------
Cumulative Return Versus Compound Return . Along with the cumulative return , a mutual fund or other investment usually indicates its compound return . Unlike the cumulative return , the compound return figure is annualized .
--------------------------
Cumulative Return Versus Compound Return . While cumulative returns may sound more impressive than the usually smaller annualized rate of return , they typically omit the effect of the annual expenses on the returns an investor will truly receive . Annual expenses an investor may expect include fund total expense ratios , interest rates on loans and management fees . When worked out on a cumulative basis , these fees can substantially eat into cumulative return numbers .
