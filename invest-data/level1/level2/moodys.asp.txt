What Is Moody 's ? . Moody 's Corporation is the holding company that owns both Moody 's Investor Services , which rates fixed income debt securities , and Moody 's Analytics , which provides software and research for economic analysis and risk management . Moody 's assigns ratings on the basis of assessed risk and the borrower 's ability to make interest payments , and its ratings are closely watched by many investors .
--------------------------
Moody 's Explained . Investors worldwide pay close attention to the ratings that Moody 's assigns to bonds , preferred stock , and government entities . Moody 's ratings go from AAA , which is the highest grade for the top quality issuer with the lowest risk down to C , which is usually given to securities that are in default with little chance of the principal being repaid .
--------------------------
Background . Moody 's dates back to " Moody 's Manual , " which was first published in 1900 ; it provided general information and statistics about stocks and bonds . In 1909 , " Moody 's Analyses of Railroad Investments " added analytic information about debt instruments . Moody 's Investor Services was established in 1914 and built on that foundation . It was bought by credit reporting company Dun & Bradstreet in 1962 but was spun off in 2000 ; it has been an independent company since .
--------------------------
Background . In 1975 , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made Moody 's a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization , along with Standard & Poor 's and Fitch . Many institutions require a certain level of credit rating from an NRSRO entity in order to buy a given issue ; the rating also impacts the capital requirements that the Securities and Exchange Commission applies to banks in the United States .
--------------------------
2008 Financial Crisis . Moody 's , S&P , and Fitch have all been heavily criticized for their role in the financial market crisis of 2008 . Much of the criticism centers around the AAA ratings that were given to mortgage - backed securities that in many cases were comprised of subprime loans . The ratings agencies ' highly complex models failed to take into account the possibility of a broad nationwide decline in housing prices and how that would impact the performance of the bonds .
--------------------------
2008 Financial Crisis . In 2007 , as housing prices began a widespread decline , Moody 's downgraded 83 % of the mortgage securities that had been rated AAA just one year earlier . The prevalence of a system in which a bond 's issuers pay the ratings company for their work has been blamed by some observers for inflated ratings . Moody 's competitor S&P paid $ 1.5 billion to the Justice Department , 19 states , and the District of Columbia to resolve allegations that it knowingly misled investors .
--------------------------
2008 Financial Crisis . Moody 's was criticized by many Europeans for aggressive sovereign ratings downgrades during the crisis , at a time when the U.S. government rating remained AAA despite budgetary problems .
--------------------------
Increased Oversight . The Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , which was passed in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis , established the Office of Credit Ratings within the SEC ; the commission was also given broad supervisory powers over the three NRSROs . The OCR is required to review the performance of the agencies on an annual basis and can fine or de - register them if necessary .
