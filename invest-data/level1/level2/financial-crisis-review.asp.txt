The 2007 - 08 Financial Crisis in Review . When the Wall Street evangelists started preaching " no bailout for you " before the collapse of British bank Northern Rock , they hardly knew that history would ultimately have the last laugh . With the onset of the global credit crunch and the fall of Northern Rock , August 2007 turned out to be just the starting point for significant financial landslides . Many people lost their retirement accounts during the process .
--------------------------
The 2007 - 08 Financial Crisis in Review . Since then , we have seen many big names rise , fall and fall even more . In this article , we 'll recap how the financial crisis of 2007 - 08 unfolded .
--------------------------
Before the Beginning . Like all previous cycles of booms and busts , the seeds of the subprime meltdown were sown during unusual times . In 2001 , the U.S. economy experienced a mild , short - lived recession . Although the economy nicely withstood terrorist attacks , the bust of the dot - com bubble and accounting scandals , the fear of recession really preoccupied everybody 's minds .
--------------------------
Before the Beginning . To keep recession away , the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate 11 times - from 6.5 % in May 2000 to 1.75 % in December 2001 - creating a flood of liquidity in the economy . Cheap money , once out of the bottle , always looks to be taken for a ride . It found easy prey in restless bankers â€” and even more restless borrowers who had no income , no job and no assets . These subprime borrowers wanted to realize their life 's dream of acquiring a home . For them , holding the hands of a willing banker was a new ray of hope . More home loans , more home buyers , more appreciation in home prices . It was n't long before things started to move just as the cheap money wanted them to .
--------------------------
Before the Beginning . This environment of easy credit and the upward spiral of home prices made investments in higher yielding subprime mortgages look like a new rush for gold . The Fed continued slashing interest rates , emboldened , perhaps , by continued low inflation despite lower interest rates . In June 2003 , the Fed lowered interest rates to 1 % , the lowest rate in 45 years . The whole financial market started resembling a candy shop where everything was selling at a huge discount and without any down payment . " Lick your candy now and pay for it later " - the entire subprime mortgage market seemed to encourage those with a sweet tooth for have - it - now investments . Unfortunately , no one was there to warn about the tummy aches that would follow .
--------------------------
Before the Beginning . But the bankers thought that it just was n't enough to lend the candies lying on their shelves . They decided to repackage candy loans into collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and pass on the debt to another candy shop . Hurrah ! Soon a big secondary market for originating and distributing subprime loans developed . To make things merrier , in October 2004 , the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) relaxed the net capital requirement for five investment banks - Goldman Sachs ( NYSE : GS ) , Merrill Lynch ( NYSE : MER ) , Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley ( NYSE : MS ) - which freed them to leverage up to 30-times or even 40-times their initial investment . Everybody was on a sugar high , feeling as if the cavities were never going to come .
--------------------------
The Beginning of the End . But , every good item has a bad side and several of these factors started to emerge alongside one another . The trouble started when the interest rates started rising , and home ownership reached a saturation point . From June 30 , 2004 , onward , the Fed started raising rates so much that by June 2006 , the Federal funds rate had reached 5.25 % ( which remained unchanged until August 2007 ) .
--------------------------
The Beginning of the End . Declines BeginThere were early signs of distress : by 2004 , U.S. homeownership had peaked at 70 % ; no one was interested in buying or eating more candy . Then , during the last quarter of 2005 , home prices started to fall , which led to a 40 % decline in the U.S. Home Construction Index during 2006 . Not only were new homes being affected , but many subprime borrowers now could not withstand the higher interest rates and they started defaulting on their loans .
--------------------------
The Beginning of the End . This caused 2007 to start with bad news from multiple sources . Every month , one subprime lender or another was filing for bankruptcy . During February and March 2007 , more than 25 subprime lenders filed for bankruptcy , which was enough to start the tide . In April , well - known New Century Financial also filed for bankruptcy .
--------------------------
The Beginning of the End . Investments and the PublicProblems in the subprime market began hitting the news , raising more people 's curiosity . Horror stories started to leak out .
--------------------------
The Beginning of the End . According to 2007 news reports , financial firms and hedge funds owned more than $ 1 trillion in securities backed by these now - failing subprime mortgages - enough to start a global financial tsunami if more subprime borrowers started defaulting . By June , Bear Stearns stopped redemptions in two of its hedge funds and Merrill Lynch seized $ 800 million in assets from two Bear Stearns hedge funds . But even this large move was only a small affair in comparison to what was to happen in the months ahead .
--------------------------
August 2007 : The Landslide Begins . It became apparent in August 2007 that the financial market could not solve the subprime crisis on its own and the problems spread beyond the UnitedState 's borders . The interbank market froze completely , largely due to prevailing fear of the unknown amidst banks . Northern Rock , a British bank , had to approach the Bank of England for emergency funding due to a liquidity problem . By that time , central banks and governments around the world had started coming together to prevent further financial catastrophe .
--------------------------
Multidimensional Problems . The subprime crisis 's unique issues called for both conventional and unconventional methods , which were employed by governments worldwide . In a unanimous move , central banks of several countries resorted to coordinated action to provide liquidity support to financial institutions . The idea was to put the interbank market back on its feet .
--------------------------
Multidimensional Problems . The Fed started slashing the discount rate as well as the funds rate , but bad news continued to pour in from all sides . Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy , Indymac bank collapsed , Bear Stearns was acquired by JP Morgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) , Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were put under the control of the U.S. federal government .
--------------------------
Multidimensional Problems . By October 2008 , the Federal funds rate and the discount rate were reduced to 1 % and 1.75 % , respectively . Central banks in England , China , Canada , Sweden , Switzerland and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) also resorted to rate cuts to aid the world economy . But rate cuts and liquidity support in itself were not enough to stop such a widespread financial meltdown .
--------------------------
Multidimensional Problems . The U.S. government then came out with National Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , which created a corpus of $ 700 billion to purchase distressed assets , especially mortgage - backed securities . Different governments came out with their versions of bailout packages , government guarantees and outright nationalization .
--------------------------
Crisis of Confidence After All . The financial crisis of 2007 - 08 has taught us that the confidence of the financial market , once shattered , ca n't be quickly restored . In an interconnected world , a seeming liquidity crisis can very quickly turn into a solvency crisis for financial institutions , a balance of payment crisis for sovereign countries and a full - blown crisis of confidence for the entire world . But the silver lining is that , after every crisis in the past , markets have come out strong to forge new beginnings with some kind of turnaround . A small selection of investors even profited from the crisis .
