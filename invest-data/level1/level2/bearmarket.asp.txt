What Is a Bear Market ? . A bear market is a condition in which securities prices fall 20 % or more from recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment . Typically , bear markets are associated with declines in an overall market or index like the S&P 500 , but individual securities or commodities can be considered to be in a bear market if they experience a decline of 20 % or more over a sustained period of time - typically two months or more .
--------------------------
What Is a Bear Market ? . The U.S. major market indexes fell into bear market territory on December 24th , 2018 . The last prolonged bear market in the United States occurred between 2007 and 2009 during the Financial Crisis and lasted for roughly 17 months . The S&P 500 lost 50 % of its value during that time .
--------------------------
Secular and Cyclical Bear Markets . Bear markets can last for multiple years or just several weeks . A secular bear market can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years and is characterized by below average returns on a sustained basis . There may be rallies within secular bear markets where stocks or indexes rally for a period , but the gains are not sustained , and prices revert to lower levels .
--------------------------
Secular and Cyclical Bear Markets . A cyclical bear market can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years .
--------------------------
The Naming of Bear and Bull . The term “ bear market ” is the opposite of a “ bull market , ” or market where prices for securities are rising or are expected to rise .
--------------------------
The Naming of Bear and Bull . The bear market phenomenon gets its name from the way in which a bear attacks its prey — swiping its paws downward . This is why markets with falling stock prices are called bear markets . Just like the bear market , the bull market is named after the way in which the bull attacks by thrusting its horns up into the air .
--------------------------
What Causes a Bear Market ? . The causes of a bear market often vary , but in general , a weak or slowing or sluggish economy will bring with it a bear market . The signs of a weak or slowing economy are typically low employment , low disposable income , weak productivity and a drop in business profits . In addition , any intervention by the government in the economy can also trigger a bear market .
--------------------------
What Causes a Bear Market ? . For example , changes in the tax rate or in the federal funds rate can lead to a bear market . Similarly , a drop in investor confidence may also signal the onset of a bear market . When investors believe something is about to happen , they will take action — in this case , selling off shares to avoid losses .
--------------------------
Phases of a Bear Market . Bear markets usually have four different phases .
--------------------------
Bear Market vs. Correction . A bear market should not be confused with a correction , which is a short - term trend that has a duration of fewer than two months . While corrections offer a good time for value investors to find an entry point into stock markets , bear markets rarely provide suitable points of entry . This barrier is because it is almost impossible to determine a bear market 's bottom . Trying to recoup losses can be an uphill battle unless investors are short sellers or use other strategies to make gains in falling markets .
--------------------------
Bear Market vs. Correction . Between 1900 and 2018 , there were 33 bear markets , averaging one every 3.5 years . One of the most recent bear markets coincided with the global financial crisis occurring between October 2007 and March 2009 . During that time the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) declined 54 % . As of December 2018 , some forecasters predict that we are headed toward another bear market .
--------------------------
Short Selling in Bear Markets . Investors can make gains in a bear market by short selling . This technique involves selling borrowed shares and buying them back at lower prices . It is an extremely risky trade and can cause heavy losses if it does not work out . A short seller must borrow the shares from a broker before a short sell order is placed . The short seller ’s profit and loss amount is the difference between the price where the shares were sold and the price where they were bought back , referred to as " covered . "
--------------------------
Short Selling in Bear Markets . For example , an investor shorts 100 shares of a stock at $ 94 . The price falls and the shares are covered at $ 84 . The investor pockets a profit of $ 10 x 100 = $ 1,000 . If the stock trades higher unexpectedly , the investor is forced to buy back the shares at a premium , causing heavy losses .
--------------------------
Puts and Inverse ETFs in Bear Markets . A put option gives the owner the freedom , but not the responsibility , to sell a stock at a specific price on , or before , a certain date . Put options can be used to speculate on falling stock prices , and hedge against falling prices to protect long - only portfolios . Investors must have options privileges in their accounts to make such trades .
--------------------------
Puts and Inverse ETFs in Bear Markets . Inverse ETFs are designed to change values in the opposite direction of the index they track . For example , the inverse ETF for the S&P 500 would increase by 1 % if the S&P 500 index decreased by 1 % . There are many leveraged inverse ETFs that magnify the returns of the index they track by two and three times . Like options , inverse ETFs can be used to speculate or protect portfolios .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Bear Markets . The ballooning housing mortgage default crisis caught up with the stock market in October 2007 . Back then , the S&P 500 had touched a high of 1565.15 October 9 . By March 5 , 2009 , it had crashed to 682.55 as the extent and ramifications of housing mortgage defaults on the overall economy became clear .
--------------------------
Real World Examples of Bear Markets . Other examples are the 1929 Great Depression . The aftermath of the bursting of the dot com bubble in March 2000 , which wiped out approximately 49 % of the S&P 500 's value and lasted until October 2002 , is another example .
