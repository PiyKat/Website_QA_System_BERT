What is a Redemption Mechanism . A redemption mechanism refers to how market makers of exchange traded funds ( ETF ) help to reconcile the differences between net asset value ( NAV ) and market values when shares of the ETFs trade at discounts or premiums to their NAV . ETF authorized participants use the advantages that they have through the redemption process to move ETF market prices .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Redemption Mechanism . The redemption mechanism is a mechanism used by authorized ETF participants . It can also be referred to as the creation / redemption mechanism .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Redemption Mechanism . Authorized participants are broker - dealers who sell and redeem shares for ETF issuers . They partner with ETF issuers throughout the market . Authorized participants have agreements in place with ETF issuers on the number of ETF shares the issuer chooses to create and redeem . This power allows them to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities arising from discounts and premiums to ETF NAV prices . It also creates a mechanism that keeps ETF prices trading close to their accounting NAV .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Redemption Mechanism . Authorized participants and the redemption mechanism are unique from mutual funds or unit investment trusts . Open - end mutual funds can only be bought or sold at their NAV , which is calculated at the end of the trading day . Unit investment trusts can trade more fluidly , however the structure allows them to trade away from the NAV of the underlying portfolio . Closed - end funds are similar to unit investment trusts since they also trade throughout the day with prices that can differ from the NAV . Neither unit investment trusts nor closed - end funds has the advantage of authorized participants who can use the redemption mechanism to manage the market price .
--------------------------
Redemption Mechanism Trades . ETF creation units and redemption units rely on transactions that involve the underlying securities in exchange for ETF shares . If an authorized participant wants to contract with an ETF issuer for creation units of ETF shares , they will buy the underlying securities in the open market and transact them in - kind for the ETF shares in a creation unit . This can be called the creation mechanism . Similarly if an authorized participant wants to redeem shares , they do so for an in - kind transaction , receiving the underlying securities in exchange for the ETF shares . Authorized participants and ETF issuers have comprehensive access to the financial markets for transacting creation and redemption units with in - kind shares . The in - kind transaction mechanism involved with the creation and redemption of ETF shares is what keeps ETF shares trading more closely in line with their accounting NAV .
