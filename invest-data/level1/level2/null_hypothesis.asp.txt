What Is a Null Hypothesis ? . A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that no statistical significance exists in a set of given observations . The null hypothesis attempts to show that no variation exists between variables or that a single variable is no different than its mean . It is presumed to be true until statistical evidence nullifies it for an alternative hypothesis .
--------------------------
What Is a Null Hypothesis ? . For example , if the hypothesis test is set up so that the alternative hypothesis states that the population parameter is not equal to the claimed value . Therefore , the cook time for the population mean is not equal to 12 minutes ; rather , it could be less than or greater than the stated value . If the null hypothesis is accepted or the statistical test indicates that the population mean is 12 minutes , then the alternative hypothesis is rejected . And vice - versa .
--------------------------
How a Null Hypothesis Works . The null hypothesis , also known as the conjecture , assumes that any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance . The opposite of the null hypothesis is known as the alternative hypothesis .
--------------------------
How a Null Hypothesis Works . The null hypothesis is the initial statistical claim that the population mean is equivalent to the claimed . For example , assume the average time to cook a specific brand of pasta is 12 minutes . Therefore , the null hypothesis would be stated as , " The population mean is equal to 12 minutes . " Conversely , the alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that is accepted if the null hypothesis is rejected .
--------------------------
How a Null Hypothesis Works . Hypothesis testing allows a mathematical model to validate or reject a null hypothesis within a certain confidence level . Statistical hypotheses are tested using a four - step process . The first step is for the analyst to state the two hypotheses so that only one can be right . The next step is to formulate an analysis plan , which outlines how the data will be evaluated . The third step is to carry out the plan and physically analyze the sample data . The fourth and final step is to analyze the results and either accept or reject the null hypothesis .
--------------------------
Important . Analysts look to reject the null hypothesis to rule out some variable(s ) as explaining the phenomena of interest .
--------------------------
Null Hypothesis Example . Here is a simple example : A school principal reports that students in her school score an average of 7 out of 10 in exams . To test this “ hypothesis , ” we record marks of say 30 students ( sample ) from the entire student population of the school ( say 300 ) and calculate the mean of that sample . We can then compare the ( calculated ) sample mean to the ( reported ) population mean and attempt to confirm the hypothesis .
--------------------------
Null Hypothesis Example . Take another example : the annual return of a particular mutual fund is 8 % . Assume that mutual fund has been in existence for 20 years . We take a random sample of annual returns of the mutual fund for , say , five years ( sample ) and calculate its mean . We then compare the ( calculated ) sample mean to the ( claimed ) population mean to verify the hypothesis .
--------------------------
Null Hypothesis Example . Usually , the reported value ( or the claim statistics ) is stated as the hypothesis and presumed to be true . For the above examples , hypothesis will be :
--------------------------
Null Hypothesis Example . This stated description constitutes the “ Null Hypothesis ( H0 ) ” and is assumed to be true – the way a defendant in a jury trial is presumed innocent until proven guilty by the evidence presented in court . Similarly , hypothesis testing starts by stating and assuming a “ null hypothesis , ” and then the process determines whether the assumption is likely to be true or false .
--------------------------
Null Hypothesis Example . The important point to note is that we are testing the null hypothesis because there is an element of doubt about its validity . Whatever information that is against the stated null hypothesis is captured in the Alternative Hypothesis ( H1 ) . For the above examples , the alternative hypothesis would be :
--------------------------
Null Hypothesis Example . In other words , the alternative hypothesis is a direct contradiction of the null hypothesis .
--------------------------
Hypothesis Testing for Investments . As an example related to financial markets , assume Alice sees that her investment strategy produces higher average returns than simply buying and holding a stock . The null hypothesis claims that there is no difference between the two average returns , and Alice has to believe this until she proves otherwise . Refuting the null hypothesis would require showing statistical significance , which can be found using a variety of tests . Therefore , the alternative hypothesis would state that the investment strategy has a higher average return than a traditional buy - and - hold strategy .
--------------------------
Hypothesis Testing for Investments . The p - value is used to determine the statistical significance of the results . A p - value that is less than or equal to 0.05 is usually used to indicate whether there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis . If Alice conducts one of these tests , such as a test using the normal model , and proves that the difference between her returns and the buy - and - hold returns is significant , or the p - value is less than or equal to 0.05 , she can then refute the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis .
