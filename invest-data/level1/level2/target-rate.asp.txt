What Is a Target Rate ? . The target rate is the interest rate charged by one depository institution on an overnight sale of balances at the Federal Reserve to another depository institution , as determined by the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) of the Federal Reserve . A target range is sometimes designated by the FOMC along with the target rate during times of economic uncertainty . The target rate is often related to the risk - free rate in an economy .
--------------------------
What Is a Target Rate ? . The FOMC controls the target rate through open market operations ( OMO ) , which involves the purchases and sales of securities such as U.S. Treasuries or mortgage - backed securities in the open market . It is considered a target interest rate because the actual value of the rate will depend on the supply and demand for overnight lending in the open market . However , because a bank demanding overnight reserves could borrow from the Fed itself at the discount window , the target rate tends to stay enforced .
--------------------------
Explaining the Target Rate . The 12 members of the Fed Open Market Committee meet for eight regularly scheduled meetings per year . During these meetings , the FOMC reviews economic and financial conditions and determines the federal funds target rate . A decline in the target rate could stimulate economic growth ; however , too much activity can cause inflation pressures to build .

Explaining the Target Rate . On the other hand , a rise in the rate limits economic growth and helps control inflation pressures ; however , too much of an increase can stall economic growth or even cause it to decline . The FOMC generally seeks a target rate that will achieve the maximum rate of economic growth without sparking inflation .
--------------------------
Explaining the Target Rate . The FOMC may schedule additional meetings as necessary to implement changes in the target federal funds rate . At any of the FOMC 's meetings , the federal funds target rate may increase , decrease or remain unchanged depending on the economic conditions in the United States . A target is typically tied to a particular inflation level considered benign for an economy .
--------------------------
Explaining the Target Rate . For instance , in the Janet Yellen era , the target rate for the federal funds rate was tied to 2 % annual inflation . A change in the federal funds rate can affect other short - term interest rates , longer - term interest rates , foreign exchange rates , stock prices , the amount of money and credit in the economy , employment and the prices of goods and services .
--------------------------
Calculating the Target Rate . Central banks set the target rate using the Taylor Rule . This rule helps central bankers making recommendations that the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates when inflation is high or when employment exceeds full employment levels . Conversely , when inflation and employment levels are low , target interest rates should be decreased . Introduced by economist John Taylor , this formula was established to adjust and set prudent rates for the short - term stabilization of the economy , while still maintaining long - term growth . The rule is based on three factors :
