Introduction to Investing . The investment landscape can be extremely dynamic and ever - evolving . But those who take the time to understand the basic principles and the different asset classes stand to gain significantly over the long haul . The first step : learning to distinguish different types of investments and what rung each occupies on the " risk ladder . "
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . Here are the major asset classes , in ascending order of risk , on the investment risk ladder .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . A cash bank deposit is the simplest , most easily understandable investment asset — and the safest . Not only does it give investors precise knowledge of the interest they 'll earn , but it also guarantees they 'll get their capital back . On the downside , the interest earned from cash socked away in a savings account seldom beats inflation . Certificates of Deposit ( CDs ) are highly liquid instruments , very similar to cash that are instruments that typically provide higher interest rates than those in savings accounts . However , money is locked up for a period of time and there are potential early withdrawal penalties involved .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . A bond is a debt instrument representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower . A typical bond will involve either a corporation or a government agency , where the borrower will issue a fixed interest rate to the lender in exchange for using their capital . Bonds are commonplace in organizations that use them in order to finance operations , purchases , or other projects .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . Bond rates are essentially determined by the interest rates . Due to this , they are heavily traded during periods of quantitative easing or when the Federal Reserve — or other central banks — raise interest rates .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . Shares of stock let investors participate in the company ’s success via increases in the stock ’s price and through dividends . Shareholders have a claim on the company ’s assets in the event of liquidation ( that is , the company going bankrupt ) but do not own the assets . Holders of common stock enjoy voting rights at shareholders ’ meetings . Holders of preferred stock do n’t have voting rights but do receive preference over common shareholders in terms of the dividend payments .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . A mutual fund is a type of investment where more than one investor pools their money together in order to purchase securities . Mutual funds are not necessarily passive , as they are managed by portfolio managers who allocate and distribute the pooled investment into stocks , bonds , and other securities . Individuals may invest in mutual funds for as little as $ 1,000 / share , letting them diversify into as many as 100 different stocks contained within a given portfolio .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . Mutual funds are sometimes designed to mimic underlying indexes such as the S&P 500 or DOW Industrial Index . There are also many mutual funds that are actively managed , meaning they are updated by portfolio managers who carefully track and adjust their allocations within the fund . However , these funds generally have greater costs — such as yearly management fees and front - end charges — which can cut into an investor 's returns .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . Mutual funds are valued at the end of the trading day , and all buy and sell transactions are likewise executed after the market closes .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . Exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) have become quite popular since their introduction back in the mid-1990s . ETFs are similar to mutual funds , but they trade throughout the day , on a stock exchange . In this way , they mirror the buy - and - sell behavior of stocks . This also means their value can change drastically during the course of a trading day .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . ETFs can track an underlying index such as the S&P 500 or any other " basket " of stocks the issuer of the ETF wants to underline a specific ETF with . This can include anything from emerging markets , commodities , individual business sectors such as biotechnology or agriculture , and more . Due to the ease of trading and broad coverage , ETFs are extremely popular with investors .
--------------------------
Understanding the Investment ' Risk Ladder ' . There is a vast universe of alternative investments , including the following sectors :
--------------------------
How to Invest Sensibly , Suitably and Simply . Many veteran investors diversify their portfolios using the asset classes listed above , with the mix reflecting their tolerance for risk . A good piece of advice to investors is to start with simple investments , then incrementally expand their portfolios . Specifically , mutual funds or ETF 's exchange - traded funds are a good first step , before moving on to individual stocks , real estate , and other alternative investments .
--------------------------
How to Invest Sensibly , Suitably and Simply . However , most people are too busy to worry about monitoring their portfolios on a daily basis . Therefore , sticking with index funds that mirror the market is a viable solution . Steven Goldberg , a principal at the firm Tweddell Goldberg Investment Management and longtime mutual funds columnist at Kiplinger.com further argues that most individuals only need three index funds : one covering the U.S. equity market , another with international equities and the third tracking a bond index .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . Investment education is essential — as is avoiding investments you do n't fully understand . Rely on sound recommendations from experienced investors , while dismissing " hot tips " from untrustworthy sources . When consulting professionals , look to independent financial advisors who get paid only for their time , instead of those who collect commissions . And above all : Diversify your holdings across a wide swath of assets .
