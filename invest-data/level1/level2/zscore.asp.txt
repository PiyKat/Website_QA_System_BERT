What Is a Z - Score ? . A Z - score is a numerical measurement used in statistics of a value 's relationship to the mean ( average ) of a group of values , measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean . If a Z - score is 0 , it indicates that the data point 's score is identical to the mean score . A Z - score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean . Z - scores may be positive or negative , with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean .

What Is a Z - Score ? . Z - scores are measures of an observation 's variability and can be put to use by traders in determining market volatility . The Z - score is more commonly known as the Altman Z - score .
--------------------------
The Altman Z - Score Formula . The Altman Z - score is the output of a credit - strength test that helps gauge the likelihood of bankruptcy for a publicly traded manufacturing company . The Z - score is based on five key financial ratios that can be found and calculated from a company 's annual 10-K report . The calculation used to determine the Altman Z - score is as follows :
--------------------------
The Altman Z - Score Formula . ﻿ζ=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0Ewhere : Zeta(ζ)=The Altman Z - scoreA = Working capital / total assetsB = Retained earnings / total assetsC = Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT)/totalassetsD = Market value of equity / book value of total liabilities\begin{aligned } & \zeta=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0E\\ & \textbf{where:}\\ & \text{Zeta}(\zeta)=\text{The Altman } Z\text{-score}\\ & A=\text{Working capital / total assets}\\ & B= \text{Retained earnings / total assets}\\ & C=\text{Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT)/total}\\ & \qquad\text{assets}\\ & D=\text{Market value of equity / book value of total liabilities}\\ & E=\text{Sales / total assets } \end{aligned}​ζ=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0Ewhere : Zeta(ζ)=The Altman Z - scoreA = Working capital / total assetsB = Retained earnings / total assetsC = Earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT)/totalassetsD = Market value of equity / book value of total liabilities​﻿

The Altman Z - Score Formula . Typically , a score below 1.8 indicates that a company is likely heading for or is under the weight of bankruptcy . Conversely , companies that score above 3 are less likely to experience bankruptcy .
--------------------------
What Do Z - Scores Tell You ? . Z - scores reveal to statisticians and traders whether a score is typical for a specified data set or if it is atypical . In addition to this , Z - scores also make it possible for analysts to adapt scores from various data sets to make scores that can be compared to one another accurately . Usability testing is one example of a real - life application of Z - scores .
--------------------------
What Do Z - Scores Tell You ? . Edward Altman , a professor at New York University , developed and introduced the Z - score formula in the late 1960s as a solution to the time - consuming and somewhat confusing process investors had to undergo to determine how close to bankruptcy a company was . In reality , the Z - score formula Altman developed ended up providing investors with an idea of the overall financial health of a company .
--------------------------
The Difference Between Z - Scores and Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is essentially a reflection of the amount of variability within a given data set . To calculate the standard deviation , first , calculate the difference between each data point and the mean . The differences are then squared , summed and averaged to produce the variance . The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance , which brings it back to the original unit of measure .
--------------------------
The Difference Between Z - Scores and Standard Deviation . The Z - score , by contrast , is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean . To calculate Z - score , simply subtract the mean from each data point and divide the result by the standard deviation .
--------------------------
The Difference Between Z - Scores and Standard Deviation . For data points that are below the mean , the Z - score is negative . In most large data sets , 99 % of values have a Z - score between -3 and 3 , meaning they lie within three standard deviations above and below the mean .
--------------------------
Altman Z - Score Plus . Altman developed and released the Altman Z - Score Plus in 2012 . This formula is used to evaluate both public and private companies and can be used for non - manufacturing companies as well as manufacturing companies . The Z - Score Plus is suitable for companies in the United States as well as non - US companies , including those in emerging economies , such as China .
--------------------------
Limitations of Z - Scores . Alas , the Z - score is not perfect and needs to be calculated and interpreted with care . For starters , the Z - score is not immune to false accounting practices . Since companies in trouble may be tempted to misrepresent financials , the Z - score is only as accurate as the data that goes into it .
--------------------------
Limitations of Z - Scores . The Z - score also is n't much use for new companies with little to no earnings . These companies , regardless of their financial health , will score low . Moreover , the Z - score does n't address the issue of cash flows directly , only hinting at it through the use of the net working capital - to - asset ratio . After all , it takes cash to pay the bills .
--------------------------
Limitations of Z - Scores . Finally , Z - scores can swing from quarter to quarter when a company records one - time write - offs . These can change the final score , suggesting that a company that 's really not at risk is on the brink of bankruptcy .
