What Is a Stakeholder ? . A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a company and can either affect or be affected by the business . The primary stakeholders in a typical corporation are its investors , employees , customers and suppliers . However , the modern theory of the idea goes beyond this original notion to include additional stakeholders such as a community , government or trade association .
--------------------------
Understanding Stakeholder . Stakeholders can be internal or external . Internal stakeholders are people whose interest in a company comes through a direct relationship , such as employment , ownership or investment . External stakeholders are those people who do not directly work with a company but are affected in some way by the actions and outcomes of said business . Suppliers , creditors and public groups are all considered external stakeholders .
--------------------------
Example of an Internal Stakeholder . Investors are a common type of internal stakeholder and are greatly impacted by the outcome of a business . If , for example , a venture capital firm decides to invest $ 5 million into a technology startup in return for 10 % equity and significant influence , the firm becomes an internal stakeholder of the startup . The return of the company 's investment hinges on the success , or failure , of the startup , meaning it has a vested interest .
--------------------------
An Example of an External Stakeholder . External stakeholders are a little harder to identify , seeing as they do not have a direct relationship with the company . Instead , an external stakeholder is normally a person or organization affected by the operations of the business . When a company goes over the allowable limit of carbon emissions , for example , the town in which the company is located is considered an external stakeholder because it is affected by the increased pollution .
--------------------------
An Example of an External Stakeholder . Conversely , external stakeholders may also sometimes have a direct effect on a company but are not directly tied to it . The government , for example , is an external stakeholder . When it makes policy changes on carbon emissions , continuing from above , the decision affects the operations of any business with increased levels of carbon .
--------------------------
Problems With Stakeholders . A common problem that arises with having numerous stakeholders in an enterprise is their various self interests may not all be aligned . In fact , they may be in direct conflict . The primary goal of a corporation , for example , from the viewpoint of its shareholders , is to maximize profits and enhance shareholder value . Since labor costs are a critical input cost for most companies , a company may seek to keep these costs under tight control . This might have the effect of making another important group of stakeholders , its employees , unhappy . The most efficient companies successfully manage the self - interests and expectations of their stakeholders .
--------------------------
Stakeholders vs. Shareholders . Stakeholders are bound to a company with some type of vested interest , usually for a longer term and for reasons of greater need . A shareholder , meanwhile , has a financial interest , but a shareholder can sell a stock and buy different stock or keep the proceeds in cash ; they do not have a long - term need for the company and can get out at any time .
--------------------------
Stakeholders vs. Shareholders . For example , if a company is performing poorly financially , the vendors in that company 's supply chain might suffer if the company no longer uses their services . Similarly , employees of the company , who are stakeholders and rely on it for income , might lose their jobs . However , shareholders of the company can sell their stock and limit their losses .
