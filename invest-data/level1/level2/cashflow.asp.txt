What is Cash Flow . Cash flow is the net amount of cash and cash - equivalents being transferred into and out of a business . At the most fundamental level , a company ’s ability to create value for shareholders is determined by its ability to generate positive cash flows , or more specifically , maximize long - term free cash flow .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Cash Flow . Assessing the amounts , timing and uncertainty of cash flows is one of the most basic objectives of financial reporting . Understanding the cash flow statement – which reports operating cash flow , investing cash flow and financing cash flow — is essential for assessing a company ’s liquidity , flexibility and overall financial performance .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Cash Flow . Positive cash flow indicates that a company 's liquid assets are increasing , enabling it to settle debts , reinvest in its business , return money to shareholders , pay expenses and provide a buffer against future financial challenges . Companies with strong financial flexibility can take advantage of profitable investments . They also fare better in downturns , by avoiding the costs of financial distress .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Cash Flow . Even profitable companies can fail if operating activities do not generate enough cash to stay liquid . This can happen if profits are tied up in accounts receivable and inventory , or if a company spends too much on capital expenditure . Investors and creditors , therefore , want to know if the company has enough cash and cash - equivalents to settle short - term liabilities . To see if a company can meet its current liabilities with the cash it generates from operations , analysts look at debt service coverage ratios .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Cash Flow . But liquidity only tells us so much . A company might have lots of cash because it is mortgaging its future growth potential by selling off its long - term assets or taking on unsustainable levels of debt .
--------------------------
Free Cash Flow . To understand the true profitability of the business , analysts look at free cash flow ( FCF ) . It is a really useful measure of financial performance – that tells a better story than net income — because it shows what money the company has left over to expand the business or return to shareholders , after paying dividends , buying back stock or paying off debt .
--------------------------
Free Cash Flow . Free cash flow = operating cash flow - capital expenditures - dividends ( though some companies do n’t because dividends are viewed as discretionary ) .
--------------------------
Free Cash Flow . For a measure of the gross free cash flow generated by a firm , use unlevered free cash flow . This is a company 's cash flow before taking interest payments into account and shows how much cash is available to the firm before taking financial obligations into account . The difference between levered and unlevered free cash flow shows if the business is overextended or operating with a healthy amount of debt .
--------------------------
Real World Example . Below is a reproduction of Walmart Inc ( WMT ) cash flow statement for the quarter ending on April 30 , 2015 . All amounts are in millions of U.S. dollars .
--------------------------
Real World Example . Let 's begin by seeing how the cash flow statement fits in with other components of Walmart 's financials . The final line in the cash flow statement , " cash and cash equivalents at end of period , " is the same as " cash and cash equivalents , " the first line under current assets in the balance sheet . The first number in the cash flow statement , " consolidated net income , " is the same as " income from continuing operations " on the income statement .
--------------------------
Real World Example . Because the cash flow statement only counts liquid assets , it makes adjustments to operating income in order to arrive at the operating income that flows in as cash and cash equivalents . Depreciation and amortization appear on the balance sheet in order to give a realistic picture of the lifetime value of assets . Operating cash flows , however , are considered at face value , so these adjustments are reversed . Meanwhile , assets that are not in cash form are deducted : inventories , for example . Investments that appear as assets on the balance sheet are deducted , because these were presumably paid for in cash . The statement also takes debt repayments , dividends and foreign exchange impacts into account . ( For related reading , see " Cash Flow and the Effect of Depreciation " )
--------------------------
Real World Example . The main takeaway is that Walmart 's cash flow was negative ( a decrease of $ 1.38 billion ) for this quarter , but that is not necessarily a bad thing as long as it retains sufficient reserves to handle short - term liabilities and fluctuations in its business .
