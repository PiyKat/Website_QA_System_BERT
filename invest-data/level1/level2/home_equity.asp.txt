What Is Home Equity ? . Home equity is the value of the homeowner ’s interest in their home . In other words , it is the real property ’s current market value less any liens that are attached to that property . The amount of equity in a house or its value fluctuates over time as payments are made on the mortgage and market forces play on the current value of that property .
--------------------------
How Home Equity Works . If a portion , or all , of a home , is purchased by means of a mortgage , the lending institution has an interest in the home until the loan obligation has been met . Home equity is the portion of a home 's current value that the owner actually possesses free and clear .
--------------------------
How Home Equity Works . Equity in a house can be attained either by a down payment during the initial purchase of the property or with mortgage payments––as a contracted portion of that payment will be assigned to bring down the outstanding principal still owed . Owners can benefit from property value appreciation as it will cause their equity value to increase .

. Home equity is an asset and is considered a portion of net worth , but it is not a liquid asset .

Ways to Leverage Home Equity . Unlike other investments , home equity can not be quickly converted into cash . The equity calculation is based on a current market value appraisal of your property . However , that appraisal is no guarantee that the property would sell at that price .

Ways to Leverage Home Equity . An owner would have the possibility to leverage their home equity in the form of collateral to attain either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) , or fixed - rate HELOC .
--------------------------
Ways to Leverage Home Equity . A home equity loan , sometimes referred to as a second mortgage loan , usually allows you to borrow a lump sum against your current home equity for a fixed rate over a fixed period of time . Many home equity loans are used to finance large expenditures like home repairs or college tuition .
--------------------------
Ways to Leverage Home Equity . A home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) is a revolving line of credit usually with an adjustable interest rate which allows you to borrow up to a certain amount over a period of time . HELOCs work in a manner similar to credit cards where and you can continuously borrow up to an approved limit while paying off the balance .

An Example of Home Equity . If a homeowner purchases a home for $ 100,000 , with a 20 % down payment and covers the remaining $ 80,000 with a mortgage , the owner has equity of $ 20,000 in the house . If the market value of the house remains constant over the next 2 years , and $ 5,000 of mortgage payments are applied to the principal , the owner now possesses $ 25,000 in home equity .
--------------------------
An Example of Home Equity . If the market value of the home had increased by $ 100,000 over those 2 years , and that same $ 5,000 from mortgage payments were applied to the principal , the owner would then have a home equity of $ 125,000 .
