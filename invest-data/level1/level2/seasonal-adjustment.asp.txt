What Is a Seasonal Adjustment ? . A seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique designed to even out periodic swings in statistics or movements in supply and demand related to changing seasons . It can , therefore , eliminate misleading seasonal components of an economic time series . Seasonal adjustment is a method of data - smoothing that is used to predict economic performance or company sales for a given period .
--------------------------
What Is a Seasonal Adjustment ? . Seasonal adjustments provide a clearer view of nonseasonal trends and cyclical data that would otherwise be overshadowed by the seasonal differences . This adjustment allows economists and statisticians to better understand the underlying , base trends in a given time series .
--------------------------
What Is a Seasonal Adjustment ? . An annual rate that has been adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations in data are therefore known as the seasonally adjusted annual rate ( SAAR ) . To calculate the SAAR for a given year , divide the unadjusted rate for a given month by its seasonality factor , and then multiply that figure by 12 to extrapolate an annual rate . If quarterly data are being used instead , multiply by four .

Seasonal Adjustment Explained . Seasonal adjustments are intended to smooth out aberrations in certain types of financial activity . For example , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) uses seasonal adjustment to achieve a more accurate portrait of employment and unemployment levels in the United States . They do this by removing the influence of seasonal events , such as the holidays , weather events , school schedules , and even the harvest period .
--------------------------
Seasonal Adjustment Explained . Seasonal events are temporary , usually have a known length , and they tend to follow a generally predictable pattern each year , at the same time of year . As a result , seasonal adjustments can remove their influence on statistical trends . Adjustments allow statisticians to more easily observe nonseasonal and underlying trends and cycles and get an accurate and useful view of the labor market and buying habits .

Seasonal Adjustment Explained . These adjustments are estimates based on seasonal activity in previous years .

Seasonal Adjustments Expose Underlying Trends . Seasonal movements can be substantial , so much so that they can often obscure other traits and trends in the data . If seasonal adjustments are not made , analyses of the data can not yield accurate results . If each period in a time series — for example , each month in the fiscal year — has a different tendency toward low or high seasonal values , it can be difficult to detect the true direction of the underlying trends of the time series . Difficulties include increases or decreases in economic activity , turning points , and other economic indicators .

How the Consumer Price Index Uses Seasonal Adjustment . The consumer price index ( CPI ) uses X-13ARIMA - SEATS seasonal adjustment software to perform seasonal adjustments of pricing data that is deemed subject to seasonal adjustments such as motor fuels , food and beverage items , vehicles , and some utilities .
--------------------------
How the Consumer Price Index Uses Seasonal Adjustment . CPI economists re - evaluate the seasonal status of each data series each year . To do this , they calculate new seasonal factors each January and apply them to the last five years of index data . Indexes older than five - years - old are considered final and are no longer revised . The Bureau of Labor Statistics reevaluates whether each series should remain seasonally adjusted or not , based upon specific statistical criteria . Intervention analysis seasonal adjustment is used when a single , nonseasonal event influences seasonally - adjusted data .
--------------------------
How the Consumer Price Index Uses Seasonal Adjustment . For example , when the global recession in 2008 affected fuel prices , intervention analysis seasonal adjustment was used to offset its effects on fuel pricing in that year . Using these methods , the CPI can formulate more accurate price indexes for components and indexes that are n't subject to seasonal adjustment .
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Seasonal Adjustment . For example , the sales of running shoes bought in the summer exceed the amount bought in the winter . This increase is due to the seasonal factor that more people run , or participate in other outdoor activities requiring similar footwear , in the summer .
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Seasonal Adjustment . The seasonal spike in running shoe sales can obscure the general trends in athletic footwear sales across the whole time series . A seasonal adjustment is therefore made to obtain a clear picture of the general trend .
