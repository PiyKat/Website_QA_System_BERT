What Is the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model – CCAPM ? . The consumption capital asset pricing model ( CCAPM ) is an extension of the capital asset pricing model ( CAPM ) that uses a consumption beta instead of a market beta to explain expected return premiums over the risk - free rate . The beta component of both the CCAPM and CAPM formulas represents risk that can not be diversified away . The consumption beta is based on the volatility of a given stock or portfolio .
--------------------------
What Is the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model – CCAPM ? . The CCAPM predicts that an asset 's return premium is proportional to its consumption beta . The model is credited to Douglas Breeden , a finance professor at Fuqua School of Business at Duke University , and Robert Lucas , an economics professor at the University of Chicago who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1995 .
--------------------------
The Formula for the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model Is . ﻿R = Rf+βc(Rm−Rf)where : R = Expected return on a securityRf = Risk - free rateβc = Consumption betaRm = Return on the market\begin{aligned } & R = R_f + \beta_c ( R_m - R_f ) \\ & \textbf{where : } \\ & R = \text{Expected return on a security } \\ & R_f = \text{Risk - free rate } \\ & \beta_c = \text{Consumption beta } \\ & R_m = \text{Return on the market } \\ \end{aligned}​R = Rf​+βc​(Rm​−Rf​)where : R = Expected return on a securityRf​=Risk - free rateβc​=Consumption betaRm​=Return on the market​﻿

What Does the CCAPM Tell You ? . The CCAPM provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between wealth and consumption and an investor 's risk aversion . The CCAPM works as an asset valuation model to tell you the expected premium investors require in order to buy a given stock , and how that return is affected by the risk that comes from consumption - driven stock price volatility .
--------------------------
What Does the CCAPM Tell You ? . The quantity of risk related to the consumption beta is measured by the movements of the risk premium ( return on asset - risk - free rate ) with consumption growth . The CCAPM is useful in estimating how much stock market returns change relative to consumption growth . A higher consumption beta implies a higher expected return on risky assets . For instance , a consumption beta of 2.0 would imply an increased asset return requirement of 2 % if the market increased by 1 % .
--------------------------
What Does the CCAPM Tell You ? . The CCAPM incorporates many forms of wealth beyond stock market wealth and provides a framework for understanding variation in financial asset returns over many time periods . This provides an extension of the CAPM , which only takes into account one - period asset returns .
--------------------------
The Difference Between CCAPM and CAPM . While the CAPM formula relies on the market portfolio 's return to predict future asset prices , the CCAPM relies on aggregate consumption . In the CAPM , the market return is typically represented by the return on the S&P 500 . Risky assets create uncertainty in an investor 's wealth , which is determined in the CAPM by the market portfolio using the market 's beta of 1.0 . CAPM assumes that an investor cares about the market return and how his portfolio 's return varies from that return benchmark .
--------------------------
The Difference Between CCAPM and CAPM . In the CCAPM formula , on the other hand , risky assets create uncertainty in consumption — how much a person will spend becomes uncertain because the level of wealth is uncertain due to investments in risky assets . The CCAPM assumes investors are more concerned about how their portfolio returns vary from a different benchmark than the overall market .
