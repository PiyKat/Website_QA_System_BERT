What Is GDP ? . Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country 's borders in a specific time period . As a broad measure of overall domestic production , it functions as a comprehensive scorecard of the country ’s economic health .
--------------------------
What Is GDP ? . Though GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis , it can be calculated on a quarterly basis as well . In the United States , for example , the government releases an annualized GDP estimate for each quarter and also for an entire year . Most of the individual data sets will also be given in real terms , meaning that the data is adjusted for price changes , and is , therefore , net of inflation .
--------------------------
The Basics of GDP . GDP includes all private and public consumption , government outlays , investments , additions to private inventories , paid - in construction costs , and the foreign balance of trade ( exports are added , imports are subtracted ) .
--------------------------
The Basics of GDP . There are several types of GDP measurements :
--------------------------
The Basics of GDP . The balance of trade is one of the key components of a country 's ( GDP ) formula . GDP increases when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers sell to foreigners exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy , otherwise known as a trade surplus . If domestic consumers spend more on foreign products than domestic producers sell to foreign consumers — a trade deficit — then GDP decreases .
--------------------------
Calculating GDP . GDP can be determined via three primary methods . All , when correctly calculated , should yield the same figure . These three approaches are often termed the expenditure approach , the output ( or production ) approach , and the income approach .
--------------------------
GDP Formula Based on Spending . The expenditure approach , also known as spending approach , calculates the spending by the different groups that participate in the economy . This approach can be calculated using the following formula : GDP = C + G + I + NX , or ( consumption + government spending + investment + net exports ) . All these activities contribute to the GDP of a country . The U.S. GDP is primarily measured based on the expenditure approach .
--------------------------
GDP Formula Based on Spending . The C is private consumption expenditures or consumer spending . Consumers spend money to buy consumption goods and services , such as groceries and haircuts . Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP , accounting for more than two - thirds of the U.S. GDP . Consumer confidence , therefore , has a very significant bearing on economic growth . A high confidence level indicates that consumers are willing to spend , while a low confidence level reflects uncertainty about the future and an unwillingness to spend .
--------------------------
GDP Formula Based on Spending . The G represents government consumption expenditure and gross investment . Governments spend money on equipment , infrastructure , and payroll . Government spending assumes particular importance as a component of GDP when consumer spending and business investment both decline sharply , as , for instance , after a recession .
--------------------------
GDP Formula Based on Spending . The I is for private domestic investment or capital expenditures . Businesses spend money to invest in their business activities ( buying machinery , for instance ) . Business investment is a critical component of GDP since it increases productive capacity and boosts employment .
--------------------------
GDP Formula Based on Spending . NX is net exports , calculated as total exports minus total imports ( NX = Exports - Imports ) . Goods and services that an economy makes that are exported to other countries , less the imports that are brought in , are net exports . A current account surplus boosts a nation ’s GDP , while a chronic deficit is a drag on GDP . All expenditures by companies located in the country , even if they are foreign companies , are included in the calculation .
--------------------------
GDP Based on Production . The production approach is something like the reverse of the expenditure approach . Instead of measuring input costs that feed economic activity , the production approach estimates the total value of economic output and deducts costs of intermediate goods that are consumed in the process , like those of materials and services . The expenditure approach projects forward from costs ; the production approach looks backward from the vantage of a state of completed economic activity .
--------------------------
GDP Based on Income . Considering that the other side of the spending coin is income , and since your expense is somebody else ’s income , another approach to calculating GDP — something of an intermediary between the two other approaches — is the income approach . Income earned by all the factors of production in an economy includes the wages paid to labor , the rent earned by land , the return on capital in the form of interest , as well as corporate profits .
--------------------------
GDP Based on Income . The income approach factors in some adjustments for some items that do n’t show up in these payments made to factors of production . For one , there are some taxes — such as sales taxes and property taxes — that are classified as indirect business taxes . In addition , depreciation , which is a reserve that businesses set aside to account for the replacement of equipment that tends to wear down with use , is also added to the national income . All this constitutes national income , which is used both as an indicator of implied production and of implied expenditure .
--------------------------
. The Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) calculates the U.S. GDP , using data ascertained through surveys of retailers , manufacturers , and builders and by looking at trade flows ; the Housing Market Index is one indicator it uses .
--------------------------
GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI . Although GDP is a widely used metric , alternative ways of measuring a country 's economy do exist . Many of them are based on nationality rather than geography .
--------------------------
GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI . GDP refers to and measures the economic activity within the physical borders of a country , whether the producers are native to that country or foreign - owned entities . In contrast , Gross National Product ( GNP ) does the opposite : It measures the overall production of a native person or corporation including those based abroad while excluding domestic production by foreigners .
--------------------------
GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI . Gross National Income ( GNI ) , another measure , is the sum of all income earned by citizens or nationals of a country regardless of whether the underlying economic activity takes place domestically or abroad . The relationship between GNP and GNI is similar to that between the production approach and the income approach to calculating GDP . GNP is an older measurement that uses the production approach , while GNI is the often preferred modern estimate and uses the income approach . With this approach , the income of a country is calculated as its domestic income plus its indirect business taxes and depreciation , as well as its net foreign factor income . Net foreign factor income is found by subtracting the payments made to foreigners from the payments made to Americans .
--------------------------
GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI . In an increasingly global economy , GNI is being recognized as possibly a better metric for overall economic health than GDP . Because certain countries have most of their income withdrawn abroad by foreign corporations and individuals , their GDP figures are much higher than those of their GNI . For instance , in 2014 , Luxembourg recorded $ 65.7 billion of GDP , while its GNI was $ 43.2 billion . The discrepancy was due to large payments made to the rest of the world via foreign corporations that did business in Luxembourg , attracted by the tiny nation 's favorable tax laws .
--------------------------
GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI . Usually , the U.S. gross national income ( GNI ) and gross domestic product ( GDP ) do not differ substantially .
--------------------------
Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services , it is subject to inflation . Rising prices will tend to increase GDP and falling prices will make GDP look smaller , without necessarily reflecting any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced . Thus , just by looking at an economy ’s un - adjusted GDP , it is difficult to tell whether the GDP went up as a result of production expanding in the economy or because prices rose .
--------------------------
Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . That ’s why economists have come up with an adjustment for inflation to arrive at an economy ’s real GDP . By adjusting the output in any given year for the price levels that prevailed in a reference year , called the base year , economists adjust for inflation 's impact . This way , it is possible to compare a country ’s GDP from one year to another and see if there is any real growth .
--------------------------
Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Real GDP is calculated using a GDP price deflator , which is the difference in prices between the current year and the base year . For example , if prices rose by 5 % since the base year , the deflator would be 1.05 . Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator , yielding real GDP . Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP because inflation is typically a positive number . Real GDP accounts for the change in market value , which narrows the difference between output figures from year to year . A large discrepancy between a nation 's real and nominal GDP signifies significant inflation ( if the nominal is higher ) or deflation ( if the real is higher ) in its economy .
--------------------------
Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year . When comparing the GDP of two or more years , real GDP is used because , by removing the effects of inflation , the comparison of the different years focuses solely on volume .
--------------------------
Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Overall , real GDP is a much better index for expressing long - term national economic performance . Take for example a hypothetical country which in the year 2009 had a nominal GDP of $ 100 billion , which grew to $ 150 billion by 2019 its nominal GDP . Over the same period of time , prices rose by 100 % . Looking at merely nominal GDP , the economy appears to be performing well , whereas the real GDP expressed in 2009 dollars would be $ 75 billion , revealing that in fact , an overall decline in real economic performance occurred .
--------------------------
GDP and PPP . There are a number of adjustments to GDP used by economists to improve its usefulness . On it 's own , simple GDP shows us the size of the economy , but tells us little about the standard of living by itself . After all , populations and costs of living are not consistent around the world . Nothing much could be gleaned by comparing the nominal GDP of China to the nominal GDP of Ireland , for example . For starters , China has approximately 300 times the population of Ireland .
--------------------------
GDP and PPP . To solve this problem , statisticians instead compare GDP per capita . GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a country 's total GDP by its population , and this figure is frequently cited to assess the nation 's standard of living . Even so , the measure is still imperfect . Suppose China has a GDP per capita of $ 1,500 , while Ireland has a GDP per capita of $ 15,000 . This does n't necessarily mean that the average Irish person is 10 times better off than the average Chinese person . GDP per capita does n't account for how expensive it is to live in a country .
--------------------------
GDP and PPP . Purchasing power parity ( PPP ) attempts to solve this problem by comparing how many goods and services an exchange - rate - adjusted unit of money can purchase in different countries – comparing the price of an item , or basket of items , in two countries after adjusting for the exchange rate between the two , in effect .
--------------------------
GDP and PPP . Real per capita GDP , adjusted for purchasing power parity , is a heavily refined statistic to measure true income , which is an important element of well - being . An individual in Ireland might make $ 100,000 a year , while an individual in China might make $ 50,000 a year . In nominal terms , the worker in Ireland is better off . But if a year 's worth of food , clothing and other items costs three times as much in Ireland than China , however , the worker in China has a higher real income .
--------------------------
Using GDP Data . Most nations release GDP data every month and quarter . In the U.S. , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) publishes an advance release of quarterly GDP four weeks after the quarter ends , and a final release three months after the quarter ends . The BEA releases are exhaustive and contain a wealth of detail , enabling economists and investors to obtain information and insights on various aspects of the economy .
--------------------------
Using GDP Data . GDP 's market impact is generally limited , since it is “ backward - looking , ” and a substantial amount of time has already elapsed between the quarter end and GDP data release . However , GDP data can have an impact on markets if the actual numbers differ considerably from expectations . For example , the S&P 500 had its biggest decline in two months on Nov. 7 , 2013 , on reports that U.S. GDP increased at a 2.8 % annualized rate in Q3 , compared with economists ’ estimate of 2 % . The data fueled speculation that the stronger economy could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve ( the Fed ) to scale back its massive stimulus program that was in effect at the time .
--------------------------
Using GDP Data . Because GDP provides a direct indication of the health and growth of the economy , businesses can use GDP as a guide to their business strategy . Government entities , such as the Federal Reserve in the U.S. , use the growth rate and other GDP stats as part of their decision process in determining what type of monetary policies to implement . If the growth rate is slowing they might implement an expansionary monetary policy to try to boost the economy . If the growth rate is robust , they might use monetary policy to slow things down in an effort to ward off inflation .
--------------------------
Using GDP Data . Real GDP is the indicator that says the most about the health of the economy . It is widely followed and discussed by economists , analysts , investors , and policymakers . The advance release of the latest data will almost always move markets , though that impact can be limited as noted above .
--------------------------
GDP and Investing . Investors watch GDP since it provides a framework for decision - making . The " corporate profits " and " inventory " data in the GDP report are a great resource for equity investors , as both categories show total growth during the period ; corporate profits data also displays pre - tax profits , operating cash flows and breakdowns for all major sectors of the economy . Comparing the GDP growth rates of different countries can play a part in asset allocation , aiding decisions about whether to invest in fast - growing economies abroad and if so , which ones .
--------------------------
GDP and Investing . One interesting metric that investors can use to get some sense of the valuation of an equity market is the ratio of total market capitalization to GDP , expressed as a percentage . The closest equivalent to this in terms of stock valuation is a company 's market cap to total sales ( or revenues ) , which in per - share terms is the well - known price - to - sales ratio .
--------------------------
GDP and Investing . Just as stocks in different sectors trade at widely divergent price - to - sales ratios , different nations trade at market - cap - to - GDP ratios that are literally all over the map . For example , according to the World Bank , the U.S. had a market - cap - to - GDP ratio of nearly 165 % for 2017 ( the latest year for available figures ) , while China had a ratio of just over 71 % and Hong Kong had a ratio of 1274 % .
--------------------------
GDP and Investing . However , the utility of this ratio lies in comparing it to historical norms for a particular nation . As an example , the U.S. had a market - cap - to - GDP ratio of 130 % at the end of 2006 , which dropped to 75 % by the end of 2008 . In retrospect , these represented zones of substantial overvaluation and undervaluation , respectively , for U.S. equities .
--------------------------
GDP and Investing . The biggest downside of this data is its lack of timeliness ; investors only get one update per quarter and revisions can be large enough to significantly alter the percentage change in GDP .
--------------------------
History of GDP . GDP first came to light 1937 in a report to the U.S. Congress in response to the Great Depression , conceived of and presented by an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research , Simon Kuznets . At the time , the preeminent system of measurement was GNP . After the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 , GDP was widely adopted as the standard means for measuring national economies , though ironically the U.S. continued to use GNP as its official measure of economic welfare until 1991 , after which it switched to GDP .
--------------------------
History of GDP . Beginning in the 1950s , however , some economists and policymakers began to question GDP . Some observed , for example , a tendency to accept GDP as an absolute indicator of a nation ’s failure or success , despite its failure to account for health , happiness , ( in)equality and other constituent factors of public welfare . In other words , these critics drew attention to a distinction between economic progress and social progress . However , most authorities , like Arthur Okun , an economist for President Kennedy ’s Council of Economic Advisers , held firm to the belief that GDP is as an absolute indicator of economic success , claiming that for every increase in GDP there would be a corresponding drop in unemployment .
--------------------------
Criticisms of GDP . There are , of course , drawbacks to using GDP as an indicator . In addition to the lack of timeliness , some criticisms of GDP as a measure are :
--------------------------
Sources for GDP Data . The World Bank hosts one of the most reliable web - based databases . It has one of the best and most comprehensive lists of countries for which it tracks GDP data . The International Money Fund ( IMF ) also provides GDP data through its multiple databases , such as World Economic Outlook and International Financial Statistics .
--------------------------
Sources for GDP Data . Another highly reliable source of GDP data is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) . The OECD provides not only historical data but also forecasts for GDP growth . The disadvantage of using the OECD database is that it tracks only OECD member countries and a few nonmember countries .
--------------------------
Sources for GDP Data . In the U.S. , the Federal Reserve collects data from multiple sources , including a country 's statistical agencies and the World Bank . The only drawback to using a Federal Reserve database is a lack of updating in GDP data and an absence of data for certain countries .
--------------------------
Sources for GDP Data . The Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) , a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce , issues its own analysis document with each GDP release , which is a great investor tool for analyzing figures and trends and reading highlights of the very lengthy full release .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . In their seminal textbook Economics , Paul Samuelson and William Nordhaus neatly sum up the importance of the national accounts and GDP . They liken the ability of GDP to give an overall picture of the state of the economy to that of a satellite in space that can survey the weather across an entire continent .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding , whether it needs a boost or restraint , and if a threat such as a recession or inflation looms on the horizon . Like any measure , GDP has its imperfections . In recent decades , governments have created various nuanced modifications in attempts to increase GDP accuracy and specificity . Means of calculating GDP have also evolved continually since its conception so as to keep up with evolving measurements of industry activity and the generation and consumption of new , emerging forms of intangible assets .
