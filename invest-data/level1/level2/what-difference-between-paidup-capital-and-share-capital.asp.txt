--------------------------
Authorized Share Capital . Authorized Share Capital is the maximum amount of share capital that a company is authorized to raise . This limit is outlined in its constitutional documents and can only be changed with the approval of the shareholders . Before a publicly - traded company can sell stock , it must specify a specific limit to the amount of share capital that it is authorized to raise .

ï»¿Issued Share Capital . Issued share capital is the total value of the shares a company elects to sell . In other words , a company may elect to only issue a portion of the total share capital with the plan of issuing more shares at a later date . Not all these shares may sell right away , and the par value of the issued capital can not exceed the value of the authorized capital . The total par value of the shares that the company sells is called its paid share capital . This is what most people refer to when speaking about share capital . Issued share capital is simply the monetary value of the portion of shares of stock a company offers for sale to investors .

Paid - Up Capital . Paid - Up Capital is the amount of money a company has been paid from shareholders in exchange for shares of its stock . Paid - up capital is created when a company sells its shares on the primary market , directly to investors . Paid - up capital is important because it 's capital that is not borrowed . A company that is fully paid - up has sold all available shares and thus can not increase its capital unless it borrows money by taking on debt . Paid - up capital can never exceed authorized share capital . In other words , the authorized share capital represents the upward bound on possible paid - up capital .
--------------------------
Characteristics of Paid - Up Capital . Paid - up capital does n't need to be repaid , which is a major benefit of funding business operations in this manner . Also called paid - in capital , equity capital , or contributed capital , paid - up capital is simply the total amount of money shareholders have paid for shares at the initial issuance . It does not include any amount that investors later pay to purchase shares on the open market .
--------------------------
Characteristics of Paid - Up Capital . Paid - up capital may have costs associated with it . In capital budgeting , paid - up capital is most often referred to as equity capital . In the great debate on the relative benefits of debt versus equity , the absence of required repayment is among equity 's main advantages . However , shareholders expect a certain amount of return on their investments in the form of capital gains and dividends . While the business is not required to return shareholder investment , the cost of equity capital can still be quite high .
--------------------------
Characteristics of Paid - Up Capital . Paid - up capital is listed under stockholder 's equity on the balance sheet . This category is further subdivided into the common stock and additional paid - up capital sub - accounts . The price of a share of stock is comprised of two parts : the par value and the additional premium paid that is above the par value . The total par value of all shares sold is entered under common stock , while the remainder is assigned to the additional paid - up capital account .
--------------------------
Characteristics of Paid - Up Capital . Paid - up capital can be used in fundamental analysis . Companies that utilize large amounts of equity funding may carry lower amounts of debt than companies that do not . A company with a debt to equity ratio that is lower than the average for its industry may be a good candidate for investing because it indicates prudent financial practices and a decreased debt burden relative to its peers .
--------------------------
Finding Authorized Versus Paid - Up Capital . The amount of authorized share capital must be listed in the company 's founding documents . Any time the authorized share capital changes , these changes must be documented and made public .
--------------------------
Finding Authorized Versus Paid - Up Capital . Paid - up capital can be found or calculated in the company 's financial statements . The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) requires publicly traded companies to disclose all sources of funding to the public .
