What Is a Government - Sponsored Enterprise ? . A government - sponsored enterprise is a quasi - governmental entity established to enhance the flow of credit to specific sectors of the American economy . Created by acts of Congress , these agencies , though privately held , provide public financial services . GSEs help to facilitate borrowing for all sorts of individuals , from students to farmers to homeowners .
--------------------------
What Is a Government - Sponsored Enterprise ? . For example , the agency Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) was originally created as a GSE in the housing sector to encourage homeownership among the middle class and working class . Other mortgage GSEs , as they are called , include Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ) and Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) , which were introduced to improve the flow of credit in the housing market , while also reducing the cost of that credit .
--------------------------
How a Government - Sponsored Enterprise Works . Government - sponsored enterprises do not lend money to the public directly . Instead , they guarantee third - party loans and purchase loans in the secondary market , thereby providing money to lenders and financial institutions .
--------------------------
How a Government - Sponsored Enterprise Works . GSEs also issue short- and long - term bonds referred to as agency bonds . The degree to which an agency bond issuer is considered independent of the federal government impacts the level of its default risk . Bond investors holding most but not all types of agency bonds have their interest payments exempt from state and local taxes .
--------------------------
How a Government - Sponsored Enterprise Works . Although GSE bonds carry the implicit backing of the U.S. government , they are not direct obligations of it , unlike Treasury bonds . For this reason , these securities will offer a slightly higher yield than Treasuries , since they have somewhat if slightly , higher credit risk and default risk .
--------------------------
The History of Government - Sponsored Enterprises . The first GSE created was in the farming sector with the inception of Farm Credit System ( FCS ) in 1916 . The Farm Credit System is a network of federally chartered borrower - owned lending institutions tasked with providing an accessible source of credit to farmers , ranchers , and others involved in agriculture .
--------------------------
The History of Government - Sponsored Enterprises . The FCS gets its huge funding capital from the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation , which sells bonds on securities markets . Another farming GSE , Federal Agricultural Mortgage Association ( Farmer Mac ) , was created in 1988 and guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest to agricultural bond investors .
--------------------------
The History of Government - Sponsored Enterprises . To stimulate the housing segment , in 1932 , the government established the Federal Home Loan Banks ( FHLB ) which is owned by over 8,000 community financial institutions . Fannie Mae , Ginnie Mae , and Freddie Mac were later chartered in 1938 , 1968 , and 1970 , respectively . The housing GSEs purchase mortgages from lenders on the secondary mortgage markets . The proceeds from the sale are used by lenders to provide more credit to borrowers or mortgagors .
--------------------------
The History of Government - Sponsored Enterprises . SLM Corporation ( Sallie Mae ) was set up in 1972 to target the education sector . The establishment originally serviced and collected federal student loans on behalf of the Department of Education . It ended its ties to the government in 2004 and now offers student loans privately , along with advice on financing higher education and federal loan programs .
--------------------------
Economic Importance of the Government - Sponsored Enterprise . Their aggregate loans in the secondary market make GSEs the largest financial institutions in the U.S. A collapse of even one GSE could lead to a downward spiral in the markets , which could lead to an economic disaster . Since they have an implicit guarantee from the government that they will not be allowed to fail , GSEs are considered by critics to be stealth recipients of corporate welfare .
--------------------------
Economic Importance of the Government - Sponsored Enterprise . In fact , following the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac received $ 187 billion worth of federal assistance almost immediately to mitigate the negative impact that the wave of defaults was wrecking on the housing market and the national economy . They were also placed into government conservatorship . Both agencies have repaid their respective bailouts since then , though they remain under the control by the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
