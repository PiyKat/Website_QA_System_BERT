What Is a Margin Call ? . A margin call occurs when the value of an investor 's margin account ( that is , one that contains securities bought with borrowed money ) falls below the broker 's required amount . A margin call is the broker 's demand that an investor deposit additional money or securities so that the account is brought up to the minimum value , known as the maintenance margin .
--------------------------
What Is a Margin Call ? . A margin call usually means that one or more of the securities held in the margin account has decreased in value below a certain point . The investor must either deposit more money in the account or sell some of the assets held in the account .
--------------------------
How Margin Calls Work . A margin call arises when an investor borrows money from a broker to make investments . When an investor uses margin to buy or sell securities , he pays for them using a combination of his own funds and borrowed money from a broker . An investor 's equity in the investment is equal to the market value of securities minus borrowed funds from the broker .
--------------------------
How Margin Calls Work . A margin call is triggered when the investor 's equity , as a percentage of the total market value of securities , falls below a certain percentage requirement , which is called the maintenance margin . The New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) and FINRA require investors to keep at least 25 % of the total value of their securities as margin . Many brokerage firms may require a higher maintenance requirement — as much as 30 % to 40 % .
--------------------------
How Margin Calls Work . Obviously , the figures and prices with margin calls depend on the percent of the margin maintenance and the equities involved . But in individual instances , the exact stock price below which a margin call will be triggered can be calculated . Basically , it will occur when the account value , or account equity , equals the maintenance margin requirement ( MMR ) . The formula would be expressed as :
--------------------------
How Margin Calls Work . Account Value = ( Margin Loan ) / ( 1-MMR )
--------------------------
How Margin Calls Work . Let ’s say you open a margin account with $ 5,000 of your own money and $ 5,000 borrowed from your brokerage firm as a margin loan . You purchase 200 shares of a marginable stock at a price of $ 50 ( under the Federal Reserve Board ’s Regulation T , you can borrow up to 50 % of the purchase price ) . Assume that your broker 's maintenance margin requirement is 30 % .
--------------------------
How Margin Calls Work . Your account has $ 10,000 worth of stock in it . In this example , a margin call will be triggered when the account value falls below $ 7,142.86 ( i.e. margin loan of $ 5,000 / ( 1 – 0.30 ) , which equates to a stock price of $ 35.71 per share .
--------------------------
What Happens After a Margin Call . Using the example above , let 's say the price of your stock falls from $ 50 to $ 35 . Your account 's now worth $ 7,000 , and it triggers a margin call of $ 100 .
--------------------------
What Happens After a Margin Call . You have one of three choices to rectify your margin deficiency of $ 100 :
--------------------------
What Happens After a Margin Call . If a margin call is not met , a broker may close out any open positions to bring the account back up to the minimum value without your approval . That means the broker has the right to sell any stock holdings , in the requisite amounts , without letting you know . Furthermore , the broker may also charge you a commission on these transaction(s ) . You are responsible for any losses sustained during this process .
--------------------------
. The best way to avoid margin calls is to use protective stop orders to limit losses from any equity positions , as well as keep adequate cash and securities in the account .
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Margin Call . An investor buys $ 100,000 of Apple Inc. using $ 50,000 of his own funds and borrowing the remaining $ 50,000 from the broker . The investor 's broker has a maintenance margin of 25 % . At the time of purchase , the investor 's equity as a percentage is 50 % . Investor 's equity is calculated as : Investor 's Equity As Percentage = ( Market Value of Securities - Borrowed Funds ) / Market Value of Securities . So , in our example : ( $ 100,000 - $ 50,000 ) / ( $ 100,000 ) = 50 % .
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Margin Call . This is above the 25 % maintenance margin . So far , so good . But suppose , two weeks later , the value of the purchased securities falls to $ 60,000 . This results in the investor 's equity tumbling to $ 10,000 ( the market value of $ 60,000 minus the borrowed funds of $ 50,000 ) , or 16.67 % ( $ 60,000 - $ 50,000 ) / ( $ 60,000 )
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Margin Call . This is now below the maintenance margin of 25 % . The broker makes a margin call , requiring the investor to deposit at least $ 5,000 to meet the maintenance margin .
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Margin Call . Why $ 5,000 ? Well , the amount required to meet the maintenance margin is calculated as :
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Margin Call . Amount to Meet Minimum Maintenance Margin = ( Market Value of Securities x Maintenance Margin ) - Investor 's Equity
--------------------------
Real World Example of a Margin Call . So , the investor needs at least $ 15,000 of equity ( the market value of securities of $ 60,000 times the 25 % maintenance margin ) in his account to be eligible for margin . But he only has $ 10,000 in investor 's equity , resulting in a $ 5,000 deficiency ( $ 60,000 x 25 % ) - $ 10,000 .
