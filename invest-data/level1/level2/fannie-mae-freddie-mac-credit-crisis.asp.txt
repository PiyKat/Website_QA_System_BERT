Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the 2008 Credit Crisis . When the housing bubble of 2001 - 2007 burst , it caused a mortgage security meltdown . This contributed to a general credit crisis , which evolved into a worldwide financial crisis . Many critics have held the United States Congress — and its unwillingness to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — responsible for the credit crisis . Here , we 'll examine the extent to which Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and their allies in Congress contributed to the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
--------------------------
Mortgage Markets : A Brief History . During the twentieth century , mortgage lending took place mostly at banks , savings and loans , thrifts , and credit unions . The most common type of mortgage was a fixed - rate mortgage . Most of the financial institutions originating mortgages held the mortgages that they originated on their books .
--------------------------
Mortgage Markets : A Brief History . Fannie Mae was chartered by the U.S. Congress as a government - sponsored enterprise ( GSE ) in 1968 , and Freddie Mac followed two years later . Fannie Mae was initially created in 1938 as part of the government , but things began to change quickly after its privatization in 1968 . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created a liquid secondary market for mortgages . This meant that financial institutions no longer had to hold onto the mortgages they originated . They could sell mortgages on the secondary market shortly after origination . Selling mortgages freed up funds for creating additional mortgages .
--------------------------
Mortgage Markets : A Brief History . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had a positive influence on the mortgage market by increasing homeownership rates in the United States . However , allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to function as implied government - backed monopolies had unintended consequences . History has shown that these consequences far outweighed the benefits these organizations provided .
--------------------------
The Privileges of GSE Status . According to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's congressional charters , which gave them GSE status , they operated with certain ties to the United States federal government . As of September 6 , 2008 , they were placed under the direct supervision of the federal government .
--------------------------
The Privileges of GSE Status . According to their congressional charters :
--------------------------
The Privileges of GSE Status . The FHFA regulates the financial safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . That includes implementing , enforcing , and monitoring their capital standards . FHFA also limits the size of their mortgage investment portfolios . HUD is responsible for the general housing missions of Fannie and Freddie .
--------------------------
The Privileges of GSE Status . Fannie and Freddie 's GSE status created certain perceptions in the marketplace . The first of these was that the federal government would step in and bail out these organizations if either firm ever ran into financial trouble . This is known as an implicit guarantee .
--------------------------
The Privileges of GSE Status . The fact that the market believed in this implicit guarantee allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to borrow money in the bond market at lower yields than other financial institutions . The yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's corporate debt , known as agency debt , was historically about 35 basis points higher than U.S. Treasury bonds . AAA - rated financial firm debt has historically yielded about 70 basis points more than U.S. Treasury bonds . Thirty - five basis points do not seem like much , but it made a huge difference because of the trillions of dollars involved .
--------------------------
Private Profits With Public Risk . With a funding advantage over their Wall Street rivals , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made sizable profits for more than two decades . Over this time period , there was frequent debate about Fannie and Freddie among economists , financial market professionals , and government officials . Did the implied government backing of Fannie and Freddie actually benefit U.S. homeowners ? Or was the government just helping the companies and their investors while creating moral hazard ?
--------------------------
Private Profits With Public Risk . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were given a government - sponsored monopoly in a large part of the U.S. secondary mortgage market . This monopoly , combined with the government 's implicit guarantee to keep these firms afloat , would later contribute to the mortgage market 's collapse .
--------------------------
Fannie and Freddie 's Growth . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac grew very large in terms of assets and mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) issued . With their funding advantage , they purchased and invested in huge numbers of mortgages and mortgage - backed securities . They made these investments with lower capital requirements than other regulated financial institutions and banks .
--------------------------
Fannie and Freddie 's Growth . Figures 1 and 2 below show the incredible amount of debt issued by the companies , their massive credit guarantees , and the vast size of their retained portfolios of mortgage investments . U.S. Treasury debt is used as a benchmark .

Fannie and Freddie 's Growth . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had many critics who raised red flags about the risks the companies were allowed to take . However , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac found many allies in Congress despite these early warnings .
--------------------------
Maintaining Monopolies . Competing firms and some government officials did call for tighter regulation of the mortgage giants . However , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hired legions of lobbyists and consultants . They also made campaign contributions through their own political action committees and funded nonprofit organizations to influence members of the U.S. Congress . They were allowed to continue to grow and take on risk under their congressional charters with implied federal backing .
--------------------------
Wall Street Rivals Join the Party . It should come as no surprise that competitors on Wall Street wanted in on the profit bonanza . They wanted to securitize and invest in the parts of the mortgage market that the federal government reserved for Fannie and Freddie . They found a way to do this through financial innovation , which was spurred on by historically low short - term interest rates .
--------------------------
Wall Street Rivals Join the Party . Wall Street began to make a liquid and expanding market in mortgage products tied to short - term interest rates , such as LIBOR , starting in about 2000 . These adjustable - rate mortgages were sold to borrowers as loans that the borrower would refinance out of long before payments adjusted upward . They frequently had exotic characteristics , such as interest - only or even negative - amortization features . Home loans were often made with lax underwriting guidelines , leading to the growth of subprime mortgages .
--------------------------
Wall Street Rivals Join the Party . Investors such as pension funds , foreign governments , hedge funds , and insurance companies readily purchased the sophisticated securities Wall Street created from home mortgages . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac saw their market shares drop . They then began to purchase and guarantee an increasing number of loans and securities with low credit quality .
--------------------------
The Party Ends . It is a simple fact that there is less risk of mortgage default when home prices are rising . The equity in a home is one of the best ways to measure the risk of default . Homeowners with large amounts of equity do not walk away from their mortgages because they have too much to lose . This is the model upon which homeowners , mortgage originators , Wall Street , credit rating agencies , and investors built the mortgage bonanza . Prices collapsed when the housing bubble burst , so many homeowners saw their equity wiped out . After losing their equity and their jobs , large numbers of homeowners were forced to default at the same time . Wall Street 's sophisticated risk models did not include this scenario .
--------------------------
The Party Ends . In 2007 , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to experience large losses on their retained portfolios , especially on their Alt - A and subprime investments . In 2008 , the sheer size of their retained portfolios and mortgage guarantees led the FHFA to conclude that they would soon be insolvent . On March 19 , federal regulators allowed the two firms to take on another $ 200 billion in debt in the hopes of stabilizing the economy . By September 6 , 2008 , it was clear that the market believed the firms were in financial trouble , and the FHFA put the companies into conservatorship . American taxpayers were left on the hook for future losses .
--------------------------
Congress Shares Some Blame . Many members of the U.S. Congress were strong supporters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . Despite warnings and red flags raised by critics , they continued to allow the companies to increase in size . Fannie and Freddie were encouraged to purchase an increasing number of lower credit quality loans to help the disadvantaged and support the market . Wall Street would probably have introduced innovative mortgage products even in the absence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . On the other hand , it might be concluded that Wall Street 's expansion into exotic mortgages was motivated by the need to compete with Fannie and Freddie . Wall Street was looking for a way to cope with the implicit guarantee given to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the U.S. Congress .
--------------------------
Congress Shares Some Blame . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created an enormous amount of debt and credit guarantees in the years leading up to 2007 . Congress should have recognized the systematic risks to the global financial system that these firms posed . They should have considered the risks to U.S. taxpayers , who would eventually foot the bill for a government bailout .
