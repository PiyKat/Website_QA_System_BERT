What Is the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) ? . The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) is a U.S. government agency responsible for the collection of taxes and enforcement of tax laws ( such as the wash sale rule ) . Established in 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln , the agency operates under the authority of the United States Department of the Treasury , and its primary purpose includes the collection of individual income taxes and employment taxes . The IRS also handles corporate , gift , excise and estate taxes , including mutual funds and dividends . People colloquially refer to the IRS as the " tax man . "
--------------------------
How the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Works . Headquartered in Washington , D.C. , the IRS services the taxation of all American individuals and companies . For the 2018 filing season ( January 1 through mid - April ) , it processed more than 140.9 million income tax returns , including both individual and corporate by May 4 . During that period the IRS collected more than $ 3.3 trillion in revenue and issued $ 282 billion in tax refunds .

How the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Works . Individuals and corporations have the option to file income returns electronically , thanks to computer technology , software programs , and secure internet connections . The overwhelming majority do so . During the 2018 tax - filing season , over 89 % of all returns made use of the e - file option .

How the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Works . The number of income taxes that use e - file has grown steadily since the IRS began the program . By comparison , 40 million out of nearly 131 million returns , or nearly 31 % , used the e - file option in 2001 .

. Although the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) recommends filing tax returns electronically , it does not endorse any particular platform or filing software .

The IRS and Audits . As part of its enforcement mission , the IRS audits a select portion of income tax returns every year . For the 2017 tax year , the agency audited approximately 1.2 million income tax returns or 0.6 % of all returns filed . This number breaks down to 0.7 % of individual income tax returns and 1.1 % of corporate tax returns ( excluding S corporations ) . Around 71 % of IRS audits occurred through the mail , while 29 % happened in the field .
--------------------------
The IRS and Audits . After rising to a peak in 2010 , the number of audits has steadily dropped each year . The amount of funding set aside for tax enforcement has declined 20 % from 2010 to 2016 , which indicates even fewer audits should occur .
--------------------------
The IRS and Audits . Reasons for an IRS audit vary , but some factors may increase the odds of an examination . Chief among them : higher income . In 2017 , the overall audit rate was one in 167 tax returns , but for someone who made more than $ 1 million income , the odds were 1 in 23 returns .
--------------------------
The IRS and Audits . And running your own business carries greater risks too . Individuals making between $ 200,000 and $ 1 million in one tax year who do n't file Schedule C ( the form for the self - employed ) have a .8 % chance of being audited , vs. 1.6.%—basically double — for those who do .
--------------------------
The IRS and Audits . Other red flags for an audit include failing to declare the right amount of income , claiming a higher - than - normal amount of deductions ( especially business - related ones ) , making disproportionately large charitable donations compared to income and claiming rental real estate losses . No single factor determines who does or does not face an IRS audit each year .
