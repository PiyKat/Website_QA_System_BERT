What Is a Commercial Bank ? . A commercial bank is a type of financial institution that accepts deposits , offers checking account services , makes various loans , and offers basic financial products like certificates of deposit ( CDs ) and savings accounts to individuals and small businesses . A commercial bank is where most people do their banking , as opposed to an investment bank .
--------------------------
What Is a Commercial Bank ? . Commercial banks make money by providing loans and earning interest income from those loans . The types of loans a commercial bank can issue vary and may include mortgages , auto loans , business loans , and personal loans . A commercial bank may specialize in just one or a few types of loans .
--------------------------
What Is a Commercial Bank ? . Customer deposits , such as checking accounts , savings accounts , money market accounts , and CDs , provide banks with the capital to make loans . Customers who deposit money into these accounts effectively lend money to the bank and are paid interest . However , the interest rate paid by the bank on money they borrow is less than the rate charged on money they lend .
--------------------------
How a Commercial Bank Works . The amount of money earned by a commercial bank is determined by the spread between the interest it pays on deposits and the interest it earns on loans it issues , which is known as net interest income .
--------------------------
How a Commercial Bank Works . Customers find commercial bank investments , such as savings accounts and CDs , attractive because they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) , and money can be easily withdrawn . However , these investments traditionally pay very low interest rates compared with mutual funds and other investment products . In some cases , commercial bank deposits pay no interest , such as checking account deposits .
--------------------------
How a Commercial Bank Works . In a fractional reserve banking system , commercial banks are permitted to create money by allowing multiple claims to assets on deposit . Banks create credit that did not previously exist when they make loans . This is sometimes called the money multiplier effect . There is a limit to the amount of credit lending institutions can create this way . Banks are legally required to keep a certain minimum percentage of all deposit claims as liquid cash . This is called the reserve ratio . The reserve ratio in the United States is 10 % . This means for every $ 100 the bank receives in deposits , $ 10 must be retained by the bank and not loaned out , while the other $ 90 can be loaned or invested .
--------------------------
Deposits . The largest source by far of funds for banks is deposits ; money that account holders entrust to the bank for safekeeping and use in future transactions , as well as modest amounts of interest . Generally referred to as " core deposits , " these are typically the checking and savings accounts that so many people currently have . In most cases , these deposits have very short terms . While people will typically maintain accounts for years at a time with a particular bank , the customer reserves the right to withdraw the full amount at any time . Customers have the option to withdraw money upon demand and the balances are fully insured , up to $ 250,000 , therefore , banks do not have to pay much for this money . Many banks pay no interest at all on checking account balances , or at least pay very little , and pay interest rates for savings accounts that are well below U.S. Treasury bond rates .

--------------------------
Deposits . If a bank can not attract a sufficient level of core deposits , that bank can turn to wholesale sources of funds . In many respects these wholesale funds are much like interbank CDs . There is nothing necessarily wrong with wholesale funds , but investors should consider what it says about a bank when it relies on this funding source . While some banks de - emphasize the branch - based deposit - gathering model , in favor of wholesale funding , heavy reliance on this source of capital can be a warning that a bank is not as competitive as its peers . Investors should also note that the higher cost of wholesale funding means that a bank either has to settle for a narrower interest spread , and lower profits , or pursue higher yields from its lending and investing , which usually means taking on greater risk .
--------------------------
Loans . For most banks , loans are the primary use of their funds and the principal way in which they earn income . Loans are typically made for fixed terms , at fixed rates and are typically secured with real property ; often the property that the loan is going to be used to purchase . While banks will make loans with variable or adjustable interest rates and borrowers can often repay loans early , with little or no penalty , banks generally shy away from these kinds of loans , as it can be difficult to match them with appropriate funding sources . Part and parcel of a bank 's lending practices is its evaluation of the credit worthiness of a potential borrower and the ability to charge different rates of interest , based upon that evaluation . When considering a loan , banks will often evaluate the income , assets and debt of the prospective borrower , as well as the credit history of the borrower . The purpose of the loan is also a factor in the loan underwriting decision ; loans taken out to purchase real property , such as homes , cars , inventory , etc . , are generally considered less risky , as there is an underlying asset of some value that the bank can reclaim in the event of nonpayment.<br/>As such , banks play an under - appreciated role in the economy . To some extent , bank loan officers decide which projects , and/or businesses , are worth pursuing and are deserving of capital .
--------------------------
Loans . Consumer lending makes up the bulk of North American bank lending , and of this , residential mortgages make up by far the largest share . Mortgages are used to buy residences and the homes themselves are often the security that collateralizes the loan . Mortgages are typically written for 30 year repayment periods and interest rates may be fixed , adjustable , or variable . Although a variety of more exotic mortgage products were offered during the U.S. housing bubble of the 2000s , many of the riskier products , including " pick - a - payment " mortgages and negative amortization loans , are much less common now . Automobile lending is another significant category of secured lending for many banks . Compared to mortgage lending , auto loans are typically for shorter terms and higher rates . Banks face extensive competition in auto lending from other financial institutions , like captive auto financing operations run by automobile manufacturers and dealers .
--------------------------
Loans . Prior to the collapse of the housing bubble , home equity lending was a fast - growing segment of consumer lending for many banks . Home equity lending basically involves lending money to consumers , for whatever purposes they wish , with the equity in their home , that is , the difference between the appraised value of the home and any outstanding mortgage , as the collateral . As the cost of post - secondary education continues to rise , more and more students find that they have to take out loans to pay for their education . Accordingly , student lending has been a growth market for many banks . Student lending is typically unsecured and there are three primary types of student loans in the United States : federally sponsored subsidized loans , where the federal government pays the interest while the student is in school , federally sponsored unsubsidized loans and private loans .
--------------------------
Loans . Credit cards are another significant lending type and an interesting case . Credit cards are , in essence , personal lines of credit that can be drawn down at any time . While Visa and MasterCard are well - known names in credit cards , they do not actually underwrite any of the lending . Visa and MasterCard simply run the proprietary networks through which money ( debits and credits ) is moved around between the shopper 's bank and the merchant 's bank , after a transaction .
--------------------------
Loans . Not all banks engage in credit card lending and the rates of default are traditionally much higher than in mortgage lending or other types of secured lending . That said , credit card lending delivers lucrative fees for banks : Interchange fees charged to merchants for accepting the card and entering into the transaction , late - payment fees , currency exchange , over - the - limit and other fees for the card user , as well as elevated rates on the balances that credit card users carry , from one month to the next .

Example of a Commercial Bank . Traditionally , commercial banks are physically located in buildings where customers come to use teller window services , ATMs and safe deposit boxes .
--------------------------
. A growing number of commercial banks operate exclusively online , where all transactions with the commercial bank must be made electronically .
--------------------------
. These “ virtual ” commercial banks often pay a higher interest rate to their depositors . This is because they usually have lower service and account fees , as they do not have to maintain physical branches and all the ancillary charges that come along with them , such as rent , property taxes , and utilities .
--------------------------
. Now some commercial banks , such as Citibank and JPMorgan Chase , also have investment banking divisions , while others , such as Ally , operate strictly on the commercial side of the business .
--------------------------
. For many years , commercial banks were kept separate from another type of financial institution called an investment bank . Investment banks provide underwriting services , M&A and corporate reorganization services , and other types of brokerage services for institutional and high - net - worth clients . This separation was part of the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 , which was passed during the Great Depression , and repealed by the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 .
--------------------------
Example of How a Commercial Bank Earns Money . When a commercial bank lends money to a customer , it charges a rate of interest that is higher than what the bank pays its depositors . For example , suppose a customer purchases a five - year CD for $ 10,000 from a commercial bank at an annual interest rate of 2 % .
--------------------------
Example of How a Commercial Bank Earns Money . On the same day , another customer receives a five - year auto loan for $ 10,000 from the same bank at an annual interest rate of 5 % . Assuming simple interest , the bank pays the CD customer $ 1,000 over five years , while it collects $ 2,500 from the auto loan customer . The $ 1,500 difference is an example of spread — or net interest income — and it represents revenue for the bank .
--------------------------
Example of How a Commercial Bank Earns Money . In addition to the interest it earns on its loan book , a commercial bank can generate revenue by charging its customers fees for mortgages and other banking services . For instance , some banks elect to charge fees for checking accounts and other banking products . Also , many loan products contain fees in addition to interest charges .
--------------------------
Example of How a Commercial Bank Earns Money . An example is the origination fee on a mortgage loan , which is generally between 0.5 % and 1 % of the loan amount . If a customer receives a $ 200,000 mortgage loan , the bank has an opportunity to make $ 2,000 with a 1 % origination fee on top of the interest it earns over the life of the loan .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . At any given point in time , fractional reserve commercial banks have more cash liabilities than cash in their vaults . When too many depositors demand redemption of their cash titles , a bank run occurs . This is precisely what happened during the bank panic of 1907 and in the 1930s .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . There is no difference between the type of money creation that results from the commercial money multiplier or a central bank , such as the Federal Reserve . A dollar created from loose monetary policy is interchangeable with a dollar created from a new commercial loan .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . Most newly created central bank money enters the economy through banks or the government . The Federal Reserve can create new assets to be carried on bank balance sheets , and then banks issue new commercial loans from those new assets . Most central bank money creation becomes and is exponentially increased by commercial bank money creation .
