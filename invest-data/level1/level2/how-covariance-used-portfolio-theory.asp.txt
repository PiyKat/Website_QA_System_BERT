How is covariance used in portfolio theory ? . Covariance is used in portfolio theory to determine what assets to include in the portfolio . Covariance is a statistical measure of the directional relationship between two asset prices . Portfolio theory uses this statistical measurement to reduce the overall risk for a portfolio . A positive covariance means that assets generally move in the same direction . Negative covariance means assets generally move in opposite directions .

How is covariance used in portfolio theory ? . Covariance is an important measurement used in modern portfolio theory ( MPT ) . MPT attempts to determine an efficient frontier for a mix of assets in a portfolio . The efficient frontier seeks to optimize the maximum return versus the degree of risk for the overall combined assets in the portfolio . The goal is to choose assets that have a lower standard deviation for the combined portfolio that is less than the standard deviation of the individual assets . This can reduce the volatility of the portfolio . Modern portfolio theory seeks to create an optimal mix of higher - volatility assets with lower - volatility assets . By diversifying the assets in a portfolio , investors can reduce risk and still allow for a positive return .

How is covariance used in portfolio theory ? . In the construction of a portfolio , it is important to attempt to reduce overall risk by including assets that have a negative covariance with each other . Analysts use historical price data to determine the measure of covariance between different stocks . This assumes that the same statistical relationship between the asset prices will continue into the future , which is not always the case . By including assets that show a negative covariance , the risk of a portfolio is minimized .

How is covariance used in portfolio theory ? . The covariance of two assets is calculated by a formula . The first step of the formula determines the average daily return for each individual asset . Then , the difference between daily return minus the average daily return is calculated for each asset , which numbers are multiplied by each other . The final step is to divide that product by the number of trading periods , minus 1 . Covariance can be used to maximize diversification in a portfolio of assets . By adding assets with a negative covariance to a portfolio , the overall risk is quickly reduced . Covariance provides a statistical measurement of the risk for a mix of assets .

How is covariance used in portfolio theory ? . The use of covariance does have drawbacks . Covariance can only measure the directional relationship between two assets . It can not show the strength of the relationship between assets . The correlation coefficient is a better measure of that strength . An additional drawback to the use of covariance is that the calculation is sensitive to higher volatility returns . More volatile assets include returns that are farther from the mean . These outlying returns can have an undue influence on the resulting covariance calculation . Large single - day price moves can impact the covariance , which leads to an inaccurate estimate of the measurement .
