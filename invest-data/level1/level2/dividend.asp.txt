What Is a Dividend ? . A dividend is the distribution of reward from a portion of the company 's earnings and is paid to a class of its shareholders . Dividends are decided and managed by the company ’s board of directors , though they must be approved by the shareholders through their voting rights . Dividends can be issued as cash payments , as shares of stock , or other property , though cash dividends are the most common . Along with companies , various mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( ETF ) also pay dividends .
--------------------------
Basics of a Dividend . A dividend is a token reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company ’s equity , and it usually originates from the company 's net profits . While the major portion of the profits is kept within the company as retained earnings , which represent the money to be used for the company ’s ongoing and future business activities , the remainder can be allocated to the shareholders as a dividend . However , at times , companies may still make dividend payments even when they do n’t make suitable profits . They may do so to maintain their established track record of making regular dividend payments .
--------------------------
Basics of a Dividend . The board of directors can choose to issue dividends over various time frames and with different payout rates . Dividends can be paid at a scheduled frequency , like monthly , quarterly or annually . For example , Walmart Inc. ( WMT ) and Unilever PLC ADR ( UL ) make regular quarterly dividend payments . Additionally , companies can also issue non - recurring special dividends either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend . Backed by strong business performance and an improved financial outlook , Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) declared a special dividend of $ 3.00 per share in 2004 , which was way above the usual quarterly dividends in the range of 8 to 16 cents per share .
--------------------------
Dividend Paying Companies . Larger , established companies with more predictable profits are often the best dividend payers . These companies tend to issue regular dividends as they seek to maximize shareholder wealth in ways aside from normal growth . Companies in the following industry sectors are observed to be maintaining a regular record of dividend payments : basic materials , oil and gas , banks and financial , healthcare and pharmaceuticals , and utilities . Companies structured as master limited partnerships ( MLP ) and real estate investment trusts ( REIT ) are also top dividend payers since their designations require specified distributions to shareholders . Funds may also issue regular dividend payments as stated in their investment objectives .
--------------------------
Dividend Paying Companies . Start - ups and other high - growth companies , such as those in the technology or biotech sectors , may not offer regular dividends . Since such companies may be in the early stages of development and may incur high costs ( as well as losses ) attributed to research and development , business expansion and operational activities , they may not have sufficient funds to issue dividends . Even profit - making early- to mid - stage companies avoid making dividend payments if they are aiming for higher - than - average growth and expansion , and may like to invest the profits back in business instead of paying dividends .
--------------------------
Important Dividend Dates . Dividend payment procedure follows a chronological order of events and the associated dates are important to determine the shareholders who qualify for receiving the dividend payment .
--------------------------
Impact of Dividends on Share Price . Since dividends are irreversible , their payments lead to money going out of the company ’s books and accounts of the business forever . Therefore , dividend payments impact share price – it rises on the announcement approximately by the amount of dividend declared and declines by a similar amount at the opening session of the ex - date .
--------------------------
Impact of Dividends on Share Price . Say a company is trading at $ 60 per share and it declares a $ 2 dividend on the announcement date . As soon as the news becomes public , the share price will shoot up by around $ 2 and hit $ 62 . Say the stock trades at $ 63 one business day prior to the ex - date . On the ex - date , it will come down by a similar $ 2 and will start trading at $ 61 at the start of the trading session on the ex - date , because anyone buying on the ex - date will not receive the dividend .
--------------------------
Why Companies Pay Dividends . Companies pay dividends for a variety of reasons . These reasons can have different implications and interpretations for investors .
--------------------------
Why Companies Pay Dividends . Dividends are expected by the shareholders as a reward for their trust in a company and the company management aims to honor this sentiment by delivering a robust track record of dividend payments . Dividend payments reflect positively on a company and help maintain investors ’ trust . Dividends are also preferred by shareholders as they are treated as tax - free income for shareholders in many jurisdictions , while capital gains realized through the sale of a share whose price has increased is taxable . Traders who look for short - term gains may also prefer getting dividend payments that offer instant tax - free gains .
--------------------------
Why Companies Pay Dividends . A high - value dividend declaration can indicate that the company is doing well and has generated good profits . But it can also indicate that the company does not have suitable projects to generate better returns . Therefore , it is utilizing its cash to pay shareholders instead of reinvesting it into growth .
--------------------------
Why Companies Pay Dividends . If a company has a long history of past dividend payments , reducing or eliminating the dividend amount may signal to investors that the company could be in trouble . The announcement of a 50 % decrease in dividends from General Electric Co. ( GE ) , one of the biggest American industrial companies , was accompanied by a decline of more than seven percent in GE ’s stock price on November 13 , 2017 .
--------------------------
Why Companies Pay Dividends . A reduction in dividend amount or a decision against making any dividend payment may not necessarily translate into bad news about a company . It may be possible that the company 's management has better plans for investing the money , given its financials and operations . For example , a company 's management may choose to invest in a high return project that has the potential to magnify returns for shareholders in the long run as compared to the petty gains they will realize through dividend payments .
--------------------------
A Note About Fund Dividends . Dividends paid by funds are different from dividends paid by companies . Funds for company dividends usually come from profits that are generated from the company 's business operations . Funds work on the principle of net asset value ( NAV ) , which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the price of the asset(s ) a fund may be tracking . Since funds do n’t have any intrinsic profits , they pay dividends that are sourced from their NAV .
--------------------------
A Note About Fund Dividends . Due to the NAV - based working of funds , regular and high - frequency dividend payments should not be misunderstood as a stellar performance by the fund . Say a bond investing fund may pay monthly dividends as it receives money in the form of monthly interest on its interest - bearing holdings . It is merely transferring the interest income fully or partially to the fund investors . A stock investing fund may also pay dividends , which may come from the dividend(s ) it receives from the stocks held in its portfolio , or by selling a certain quantity of stocks . Essentially , the investors receiving the dividend from the fund are reducing their holding value , which gets reflected in the reduced NAV on the ex - date .
--------------------------
Are Dividends Irrelevant ? . Economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued that a company 's dividend policy is irrelevant and it has no effect on the price of a firm 's stock or its cost of capital . Theoretically , a shareholder may remain indifferent to a company ’s dividend policy . In the case of high dividend payments , they can use the cash received to buy more shares . In the case of low payments , they can sell some shares to get the necessary cash they need . In either case , the combination of the value of an investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain the same . Miller and Modigliani thus conclude that dividends are irrelevant , and investors should n’t care about the firm 's dividend policy since they can create their own synthetically .
--------------------------
Are Dividends Irrelevant ? . However , in reality , dividends allow money to be made available to shareholders , which gives them the liberty to derive more utility out of it . They can invest in another financial security and reap higher returns , or spend on leisure and other utilities . Additionally , costs like taxes , brokerages , and indivisible shares make dividends a considerable utility in the real world .
--------------------------
Are Dividends Irrelevant ? . Dividends can help to offset costs from your broker and your taxes . This can make dividend investments even more attractive . Of course , to get invested in dividend - earning assets , one would need a stockbroker .
--------------------------
Buying Dividend - Paying Investments . Investors seeking dividend investments have a number of options including stocks , mutual funds , ETFs and more . The dividend discount model or the Gordon growth model can be helpful in choosing stock investments . These techniques rely on anticipated future dividend streams to value shares .
--------------------------
Buying Dividend - Paying Investments . To compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance , investors can use the dividend yield factor which measures the dividend in terms of a percent of the current market price of the company ’s share . The dividend rate can also be quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives ( dividends per share , or DPS ) . In addition to dividend yield , another important performance measure to assess the returns generated from a particular investment is the total return factor which accounts for interest , dividends , and increases in share price , among other capital gains .
--------------------------
Buying Dividend - Paying Investments . Tax is another important consideration when investing for dividend gains . Investors in high tax brackets are observed to prefer dividend - paying stocks if the jurisdiction allows zero- or comparatively lower tax on dividends than the normal rates . For example , the U.S. and Canada have a lower tax on dividend income for shareholders , while dividend gains are tax - exempt in India .
