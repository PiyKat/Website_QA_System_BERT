What is a Mean . A mean is the simple mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers . The mean for a given set of numbers can be computed in more than one way , including the arithmetic mean method , which uses the sum of the numbers in the series , and the geometric mean method . However , all of the primary methods for computing a simple average of a normal number series produce the same approximate result most of the time .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Mean . The mean is a statistical indicator that can be used to gauge the performance of : a company ’s stock price over a period of days , months , or years ; a company through its earnings over a number of years ; a firm by assessing its fundamentals such as P / E ratio , FCF , liabilities on the balance sheet , etc . ; and a portfolio by estimating its average returns over a certain period .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Mean . An analyst who wants to measure the trajectory of a company ’s stock value in the last , say 10 days , would sum up the closing price of the stock in each of the 10 days . The sum total would then be divided by the number of days to get the arithmetic mean . The geometric mean will be calculated by multiplying all the values together . The nth root of product total is then taken , in this case the 10th root , to get the mean .
--------------------------
Arithmetic vs. Geometric Mean . Let ’s put this into practice by examining the stock price of Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) over the last ten days . An investor that purchased NVDA on June 5th for $ 148.01 wants to know how well his investment has fared after 10 days . The table below shows the price and returns from June 6th to June 19th , 2017 .
--------------------------
Arithmetic vs. Geometric Mean . The arithmetic mean is 0.67 % , and is simply the sum total of the returns divided by 10 . However , the arithmetic mean of returns is only accurate when there is no volatility which is nearly impossible with the stock market .
--------------------------
Arithmetic vs. Geometric Mean . The geometric mean factors in compounding and volatility , which makes it a better metric of average returns . Since it is impossible to take the root of a negative value , add 1 to all the percentage returns so that the product total yields a positive number . Take the 10th root of this number and remember to subtract from 1 to get the percentage figure . The geometric mean of returns for the investor in the last five days is 0.61 % . As a mathematical rule , the geometric mean will always be equal to or less than the arithmetic mean .
--------------------------
Arithmetic vs. Geometric Mean . Proof that the geometric mean provides a better value is given in the table . When the arithmetic mean of 0.67 % is applied to each of the stock prices , the end value is $ 152.63 . But clearly , NVDA traded for $ 157.32 on the last day – this means that the arithmetic mean of returns is overstated . On the other hand , when each of the closing prices is raised by the geometric average return of 0.61 % , the exact price of $ 157.32 is calculated . This is an example of why the geometric mean is an accurate reflection of the true return of a portfolio .
--------------------------
Arithmetic vs. Geometric Mean . While the mean is a good tool to evaluate the performance of a company or portfolio , it should also be used with other fundamentals and statistical tools to get a better and broader picture of the investment 's historical and future prospects .
