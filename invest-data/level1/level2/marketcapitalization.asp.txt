What is Market Capitalization . Market capitalization refers to the total dollar market value of a company 's outstanding shares of stock . Commonly referred to as " market cap , " it is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company 's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share . As an example , a company with 10 million shares selling for $ 100 each would have a market cap of $ 1 billion . The investment community uses this figure to determine a company 's size , as opposed to using sales or total asset figures .

Misconceptions About Market Caps . Although it is used often to describe a company , market cap does not measure the equity value of a company . Only a thorough analysis of a company 's fundamentals can do that . It is inadequate to value a company because the market price on which it is based does not necessarily reflect how much a piece of the business is worth . Shares are often over- or undervalued by the market , meaning the market price determines only how much the market is willing to pay for its shares .
--------------------------
Misconceptions About Market Caps . Although it measures the cost of buying all of a company 's shares , the market cap does not determine the amount the company would cost to acquire in a merger transaction . A better method of calculating the price of acquiring a business outright is the enterprise value .
--------------------------
Changes in Market Cap . Two main factors can alter company 's market cap : significant changes in the price of a stock or when a company issues or repurchases shares . An investor who exercises a large number of warrants can also increase the amount of shares on the market and negatively affect shareholders in a process known as dilution .
