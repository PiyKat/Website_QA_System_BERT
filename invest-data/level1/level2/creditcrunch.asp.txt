What is a Credit Crunch ? . A credit crunch refers to a decline in lending activity by financial institutions brought on by a sudden shortage of funds . Often an extension of a recession , a credit crunch makes it nearly impossible for companies to borrow because lenders are scared of bankruptcies or defaults , resulting in higher rates .
--------------------------
Understanding a Credit Crunch . A credit crunch is an economic condition in which investment capital is hard to secure . Banks and other traditional financial institutions become wary of lending funds to individuals and corporations as they are afraid that the borrowers will default . This causes interest rates to rise as a way to compensate the lender for taking on the additional risk .
--------------------------
Understanding a Credit Crunch . Sometimes called a credit squeeze or credit crisis , a credit crunch tends to occur independently of a sudden change in interest rates . Individuals and businesses that could formerly obtain loans to finance major purchases or expand operations suddenly find themselves unable to acquire such funds . The ensuing ripple effect can be felt throughout the entire economy , as home - ownership rates drop and businesses are forced to cut back due to a dearth of capital .
--------------------------
Credit Crunch Causes . A credit crunch often follows a period in which lenders are overly lenient in offering credit . Loans are advanced to borrowers with questionable ability to repay , and , as a result , the default rate and presence of bad debt begin to rise . In extreme cases , such as the 2008 financial crisis , the rate of bad debt becomes so high that many banks become insolvent and must shut their doors or rely on a government bailout to continue .

Credit Crunch Causes . The fallout from such a crisis can cause the pendulum to swing in the opposite direction . Fearful of getting burned again by defaults , banks curtail lending activity and seek out only borrowers with pristine credit who present the lowest possible risk . Such behavior by lenders is known as a flight to quality .
--------------------------
Credit Crunch Consequences . The usual consequence of a credit crunch is a prolonged recession , or slower recovery , which occurs as a result of the shrinking credit supply . In addition to tightening credit standards , lenders may increase interest rates during a credit crunch to earn greater revenues from the reduced number of customers who are able to borrow . Increased borrowing costs take away from an individual 's ability to spend money in the economy , and it eats into business capital that could otherwise be used to grow operations and hire workers .
--------------------------
Credit Crunch Consequences . For some businesses and consumers , the effects of a credit crunch are worse than an increase in the cost of capital . Businesses unable to borrow funds at all face trouble growing or expanding , and for some , remaining in business becomes a challenge . As businesses scale back operations and trim their workforce , productivity declines and unemployment rises , two leading indicators of a worsening recession .
