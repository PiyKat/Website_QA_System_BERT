What Is an Income Tax ? . An income tax is a tax that governments impose on income generated by businesses and individuals within their jurisdiction . By law , taxpayers must file an income tax return annually to determine their tax obligations . Income taxes are a source of revenue for governments . They are used to fund public services , pay government obligations , and provide goods for citizens . Certain investments , like housing authority bonds , tend to be exempt from income taxes .

How Income Tax Works . Most countries employ a progressive income tax system in which higher - income earners pay a higher tax rate compared to their lower - income counterparts . The United States imposed the first income tax during the War of 1812 . Its original purpose was to fund the repayment of a $ 100 million debt incurred from war - related expenses . After the war , the tax was repealed and then reinstated during the early 20th century .

How Income Tax Works . In the United States , the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) collects taxes and enforces tax law . The IRS employs a complex set of rules and regulations regarding reportable and taxable income , deductions , credits , et al . The agency collects taxes on all forms of income , such as wages , salaries , commissions , investments , and business earnings .

Individual Income Tax . Individual income tax is also referred to as personal income tax and is levied on wages , salaries , and other types of income . This tax is usually a tax the state imposes . Because of exemptions , deductions , and credits , most individuals do not pay taxes on all of their income . The IRS offers a series of deductions ( e.g. deductions for health care , investments and education expenses ) which taxpayers use to reduce their taxable income . For example , if a taxpayer earns $ 100,000 in income and qualifies for $ 20,000 in deductions , the taxable income reduces to $ 80,000 ( $ 100,000 - $ 20,000 ) . Tax credits are used to reduce the taxpayer 's tax obligation or amount owed . To illustrate , if an individual owes $ 20,000 in taxes but qualifies for $ 4,500 in credits , his tax obligation reduces to $ 15,500 ( $ 20,000 - $ 4,500 ) .

Business Income Taxes . Businesses pay income taxes on their earnings ; the IRS considers corporations , partnerships , self - employed contractors , and small businesses as taxable entities . These entities report their business income and then deduct their operating and capital expenses . The difference is their taxable business income .

State and Local Income Tax . Most U.S. states also levy income taxes . As of 2019 , there are seven states with no income tax : Alaska , Florida , Nevada , South Dakota , Texas , Washington , and Wyoming . Alike these seven , New Hampshire and Tennessee do not tax earned income ; however , they do tax interest and dividend income .
