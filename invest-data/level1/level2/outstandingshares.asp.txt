What Are Shares Outstanding ? . Shares outstanding refer to a company 's stock currently held by all its shareholders , including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company ’s officers and insiders . Outstanding shares are shown on a company ’s balance sheet under the heading “ Capital Stock . ” The number of outstanding shares is used in calculating key metrics such as a company ’s market capitalization , as well as its earnings per share ( EPS ) and cash flow per share ( CFPS ) . A company 's number of outstanding shares is not static and may fluctuate wildly over time .
--------------------------
Understanding Shares Outstanding . Any authorized shares that are held by or sold to a corporation ’s shareholders , exclusive of treasury stock which is held by the company itself , are known as outstanding shares . In other words , the number of shares outstanding represents the amount of stock on the open market , including shares held by institutional investors and restricted shares held by insiders and company officers .
--------------------------
Understanding Shares Outstanding . A company ’s outstanding shares can fluctuate for a number of reasons . The number will increase if the company issues additional shares . Companies typically issue shares when they raise capital through an equity financing , or upon exercising employee stock options ( ESO ) or other financial instruments . Outstanding shares will decrease if the company buys back its shares under a share repurchase program .
--------------------------
How to Locate the Number of Outstanding Shares . In addition to listing outstanding shares , or capital stock , on the company ’s balance sheet , publicly traded companies are obligated to report the number of issued and outstanding shares and generally package this information within the investor relations sections of their websites , or on local stock exchange websites . In the United States , the figures for outstanding shares are accessible from the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) quarterly filings .
--------------------------
Stock Splits and Share Consolidation . The number of shares outstanding will increase if a company undertakes a stock split , or will reduce if it undertakes a reverse stock split . Stock splits are usually undertaken to bring the share price of a company within the buying range of retail investors ; the increase in the number of outstanding shares also improves liquidity . Conversely , a company will generally embark on a reverse split or share consolidation to bring its share price into the minimum range necessary to satisfy exchange listing requirements . While the lower number of outstanding shares may hamper liquidity , it could also deter short sellers since it will be more difficult to borrow shares for short sales .
--------------------------
Stock Splits and Share Consolidation . As an example , the online video streaming service Netflix , Inc. announced a seven - for - one stock split in 2015 . In an attempt to increase the affordability of its stock and , concurrently , number of investors , Netflix increased its issuance of outstanding shares sevenfold , thus drastically reducing stock price .
--------------------------
Blue Chip Stocks . For a blue chip stock , the increased number of shares outstanding due to share splits over a period of decades accounts for the steady increase in its market capitalization and concomitant growth in investor portfolios . Of course , merely increasing the number of outstanding shares is no guarantee of success ; the company has to deliver consistent earnings growth as well .
--------------------------
Blue Chip Stocks . While outstanding shares are a determinant of a stock ’s liquidity , the latter is largely dependent on its share float . A company may have 100 million shares outstanding , but if 95 million of these shares are held by insiders and institutions , the float of only five million may constrain the stock ’s liquidity .
--------------------------
Share Repurchase Programs . Often times , if a company considers its stock to be undervalued , it will institute a repurchase program , buying back shares of its own stock . In an effort to increase the market value of remaining shares and elevate overall earnings per share , the company may reduce the number of shares outstanding by repurchasing , or buying back those shares , thus taking them off the open market .
--------------------------
Share Repurchase Programs . Take , for example , Apple , Inc. , whose outstanding securities have a large institutional ownership of about 62 % . In March 2012 , Apple announced a buyback program , several times since renewed , of upwards of $ 90 billion . According to the New York Times , the “ primary purpose [ of the repurchase ] will be to eliminate the shareholder dilution that will occur from future Apple employee equity grants and stock purchase programs . ” Due to its enormous cash reserves , Apple has been able to repurchase its stock aggressively , thus decreasing shares outstanding increasing its earnings per share .
--------------------------
Share Repurchase Programs . As of December 2015 , Apple ’s market cap is $ 869.60 billion and it has 5.18 billion outstanding shares . The stock price is up nearly $ 170 since the buyback program was announced .
--------------------------
Share Repurchase Programs . Conversely , in May 2015 , BlackBerry , Ltd. announced a plan to repurchase 12 million of its own outstanding shares in an effort to increase stock earnings . BlackBerry plans to buy back 2.6 % of its more than 500 million outstanding float shares as an increase in equity incentive . Unlike Apple , whose excessive cash flow allows the company to spend exorbitantly to bring in future earnings , BlackBerry ’s dwindling growth suggests that its repurchase of outstanding shares comes in preparation for its cancellation .
--------------------------
Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . Since the number of outstanding shares is incorporated into key calculations of financial metrics such as earnings per share and because this number is so subject to variation over time , the weighted average of outstanding shares is often used in its stead in certain formulae .
--------------------------
Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . For example , say a company with 100,000 shares outstanding decides to perform a stock split , thus increasing the total amount of shares outstanding to 200,000 . The company later reports earnings of $ 200,000 . To calculate earnings per share for the overall inclusive time period , the formula would be as follows :
--------------------------
Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . ( Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock ( 200,000 ) ) / Outstanding Shares ( 100,000 - 200,000 )
--------------------------
Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . But it remains unclear which of the two variant outstanding share values to incorporate into the equation : 100,000 or 200,000 . The former would result in an EPS of $ 1 , while the latter would result in an EPS of $ 2 . In order to account for this inevitable variation , financial calculations can more accurately employ the weighted average of outstanding shares , which is figured as follows :
--------------------------
Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . ( Outstanding Shares x Reporting Period A ) + ( Outstanding Shares x Reporting Period B )
--------------------------
Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . In the above example , if the reporting periods were each half of a year , the resulting weighted average of outstanding shares would be equal to 150,000 . Thus , in revisiting the EPS calculation , $ 200,000 divided by the 150,000 weighted average of outstanding shares would equal $ 1.33 in earnings per share .
--------------------------
Shares Outstanding vs. Floating Stock . Floating stock is a narrower way of analyzing a company ’s stock by shares . It excludes closely held shares , which are stock shares held by company insiders or controlling investors . These types of investors typically include officers , directors , and company foundations .
