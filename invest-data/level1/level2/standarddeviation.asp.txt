What Is Standard Deviation ? . The standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance . It is calculated as the square root of variance by determining the variation between each data point relative to the mean . If the data points are further from the mean , there is a higher deviation within the data set ; thus , the more spread out the data , the higher the standard deviation .
--------------------------
What Is Standard Deviation ? . Standard deviation is a statistical measurement in finance that , when applied to the annual rate of return of an investment , sheds light on the historical volatility of that investment . The greater the standard deviation of securities , the greater the variance between each price and the mean , which shows a larger price range . For example , a volatile stock has a high standard deviation , while the deviation of a stable blue - chip stock is usually rather low .
--------------------------
The Formula for Standard Deviation . ﻿Standard Deviation=∑i=1n(xi−x‾)2n−1where : xi = Value of the ith point in the data setx‾=The mean value of the data set\begin{aligned } & \text{Standard Deviation } = \sqrt { \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_i - \overline{x}\right)^2 } { n-1 } } \\ & \textbf{where:}\\ & x_i = \text{Value of the } i^{th } \text { point in the data set}\\ & \overline{x}= \text{The mean value of the data set}\\ & n = \text{The number of data points in the data set } \end{aligned}​Standard Deviation = n−1∑i=1n​(xi​−x)2​​where : xi​=Value of the ith point in the data setx = The mean value of the data set​﻿

Using Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is an especially useful tool in investing and trading strategies as it helps measure market and security volatility — and predict performance trends . As it relates to investing , for example , one can expect an index fund to have a low standard deviation versus its benchmark index , as the fund 's goal is to replicate the index .
--------------------------
Using Standard Deviation . On the other hand , one can expect aggressive growth funds to have a high standard deviation from relative stock indices , as their portfolio managers make aggressive bets to generate higher - than - average returns .
--------------------------
Using Standard Deviation . A lower standard deviation is n't necessarily preferable . It all depends on the investments one is making , and one 's willingness to assume the risk . When dealing with the amount of deviation in their portfolios , investors should consider their personal tolerance for volatility and their overall investment objectives . More aggressive investors may be comfortable with an investment strategy that opts for vehicles with higher - than - average volatility , while more conservative investors may not .
--------------------------
Using Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is one of the key fundamental risk measures that analysts , portfolio managers , advisors use . Investment firms report the standard deviation of their mutual funds and other products . A large dispersion shows how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns . Because it is easy to understand , this statistic is regularly reported to the end clients and investors .

Standard Deviation vs. Variance . Variance is derived by taking the mean of the data points , subtracting the mean from each data point individually , squaring each of these results and then taking another mean of these squares . Standard deviation is the square root of the variance .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation vs. Variance . The variance helps determine the data 's spread size when compared to the mean value . As the variance gets bigger , more variation in data values occurs , and there may be a larger gap between one data value and another . If the data values are all close together , the variance will be smaller . This is more difficult to grasp than are standard deviations , however , because variances represent a squared result that may not be meaningfully expressed on the same graph as the original dataset .
--------------------------
Standard Deviation vs. Variance . Standard deviations are usually easier to picture and apply . The standard deviation is expressed in the same unit of measurement as the data , which is n't necessarily the case with the variance . Using the standard deviation , statisticians may determine if the data has a normal curve or other mathematical relationship . If the data behaves in a normal curve , then 68 % of the data points will fall within one standard deviation of the average , or mean data point . Bigger variances cause more data points to fall outside the standard deviation . Smaller variances result in more data that is close to average .
--------------------------
A Big Drawback . The biggest drawback of using standard deviation is that it can be impacted by outliers and extreme values . Standard deviation assumes a normal distribution and calculates all uncertainty as risk , even when it ’s in the investor 's favor — such as above average returns .
--------------------------
Example of Standard Deviation . Say we have the data points 5 , 7 , 3 , and 7 , which total 22 . You would then divide 22 by the number of data points , in this case , four — resulting in a mean of 5.5 . This leads to the following determinations : x̄ = 5.5 and N = 4 .
--------------------------
Example of Standard Deviation . The variance is determined by subtracting the value of the mean from each data point , resulting in -0.5 , 1.5 , -2.5 and 1.5 . Each of those values is then squared , resulting in 0.25 , 2.25 , 6.25 and 2.25 . The square values are then added together , resulting in a total of 11 , which is then divided by the value of N minus 1 , which is 3 , resulting in a variance approximately of 3.67 .
--------------------------
Example of Standard Deviation . The square root of the variance is then calculated , which results in a standard deviation measure of approximately 1.915 .
--------------------------
Example of Standard Deviation . Or consider shares of Apple ( AAPL ) for the last five years . Returns for Apple ’s stock were 37.7 % for 2014 , -4.6 % for 2015 , 10 % for 2016 , 46.1 % for 2017 and -6.8 % for 2018 . The average return over the five years is 16.5 % .
--------------------------
Example of Standard Deviation . The value of each year 's return less the mean is 21.2 % , -21.2 % , -6.5 % , 29.6 % , and -23.3 % . All those values are then squared to yield 449.4 , 449.4 , 42.3 , 876.2 , and 542.9 , respectively . The variance is 590.1 , where the squared values are added together and divided by 4 ( N minus 1 ) . The square root of the variance is taken to get the standard deviation of 24.3 % .
