What is the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) ? . The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) is the comprehensive healthcare reform signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010 . Formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — and simply Obamacare — the law includes a list of health - related provisions intended to extend health - insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans .
--------------------------
What is the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) ? . The Act expanded Medicaid eligibility , created health insurance exchanges , and prevents insurance companies from denying coverage ( or charging more ) due to pre - existing conditions . It also allows children to remain on their parents ' insurance plan until age 26 .

--------------------------
Understanding the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) . In addition , the Affordable Care Act requires most insurance plans ( including those sold on the Marketplace ) to cover at no cost to policyholders a list of preventive services . These include checkups , patient counseling , immunizations , and numerous health screenings . It also allowed states that opted in to extend Medicaid coverage to a wider range of people . ( To date , 37 states and the District of Columbia have exercised that option . )
--------------------------
Special Considerations . A notable part of the Affordable Care Act was the individual mandate , a provision requiring all Americans to have healthcare coverage — either from an employer or through the ACA or another source — or face increasingly stiff tax penalties . This mandate served the double purpose of extending healthcare to uninsured Americans and ensuring that there was a sufficiently broad pool of insured individuals to support health - insurance payouts .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . On Jan. 20 , 2017 , in his first executive order after taking office , President Donald Trump signaled his intention to defund the Affordable Care Act , saying executive agency heads should " delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State . "
--------------------------
Special Considerations . The intention of this order signaled the first phase of Republican efforts to repeal and replace the ACA . Rolling back the law was one of Trump 's central campaign promises aimed at reducing the fiscal burden on the government .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . Attempts by the government in 2017 to repeal the law altogether were not successful . However , the government substantially scaled back its outreach program to help Americans sign up for the ACA and cut the enrollment period in half .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . Changes have been made to the law that have addressed some of the objections raised by opponents , while still keeping the Marketplace open active for users . For example , as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , Congress in Dec. 2017 removed the penalty for not having health insurance . Starting with 2019 taxes , the individual mandate was reduced to zero dollars , essentially removing the requirement that many Republicans had opposed . By 2018 , the number of Americans covered under the ACA had dropped from 17.8 in 2015 to 13.8 in 2015 , according to a report from healthcare research organization KFF .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . In March 2019 , the Trump administration revealed it will seek to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act . The Justice Department in a letter to a federal appeals court said it agreed with a federal judge in Texas who declared the healthcare law unconstitutional and added that it will support the judgment on appeal .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . The case is expected to go to the Supreme Court with a coalition of 21 attorneys general defending the Affordable Care Act . Meanwhile , also in March 2019 , House Democrats unveiled legislation to shore up the Act and expand coverage .
