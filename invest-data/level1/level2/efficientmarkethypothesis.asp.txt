What is the Efficient Market Hypothesis ( EMH ) ? . The Efficient Market Hypothesis , or EMH , is an investment theory whereby share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible . Theoretically , neither technical nor fundamental analysis can produce risk - adjusted excess returns , or alpha , consistently and only inside information can result in outsized risk - adjusted returns .
--------------------------
What is the Efficient Market Hypothesis ( EMH ) ? . According to the EMH , stocks always trade at their fair value on stock exchanges , making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices .
--------------------------
What is the Efficient Market Hypothesis ( EMH ) ? . As such , it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing , and the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by purchasing riskier investments .
--------------------------
The Efficient Market Hypothesis Explained . Although it is a cornerstone of modern financial theory , the EMH is highly controversial and often disputed . Believers argue it is pointless to search for undervalued stocks or to try to predict trends in the market through either fundamental or technical analysis .
--------------------------
The Efficient Market Hypothesis Explained . While academics point to a large body of evidence in support of EMH , an equal amount of dissension also exists . For example , investors such as Warren Buffett have consistently beaten the market over long periods of time , which by definition is impossible according to the EMH . Detractors of the EMH also point to events such as the 1987 stock market crash , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) fell by over 20 percent in a single day , as evidence that stock prices can seriously deviate from their fair values .

Real World Implications for Investors . Proponents of the Efficient Market Hypothesis conclude that , because of the randomness of the market , investors could do better by investing in a low - cost , passive portfolio .
--------------------------
Real World Implications for Investors . Data compiled by Morningstar Inc. , in its June 2015 Active / Passive Barometer study , supports the EMH . Morningstar compared active managers ’ returns in all categories against a composite made of related index funds and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) . The study found that year - over - year , only two groups of active managers successfully outperformed passive funds more than 50 percent of the time — U.S. small growth funds and diversified emerging markets funds . In all of the other categories , including U.S. large blend , U.S. large value and U.S. large growth , among others , investors would have fared better by investing in low - cost index funds or ETFs .
--------------------------
Real World Implications for Investors . While a percentage of active managers do outperform passive funds at some point , the challenge for investors is being able to identify which ones will do so over the long - term . Less than 25 percent of the top - performing active managers are able to consistently outperform their passive manager counterparts over time .
