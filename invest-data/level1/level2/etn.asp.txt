What Are Exchange - Traded Notes – ETN ? . Exchange - traded notes ( ETNs ) are types of unsecured debt securities that track an underlying index of securities and trade on a major exchange like a stock . ETNs are similar to bonds but do not pay interest payments . Instead , the prices of ETNs fluctuate like stocks .
--------------------------
Exchange - Traded Notes Explained . An ETN is typically issued by financial institutions and bases its return on a market index . ETNs are a type of bond . At maturity , the ETN will pay the return of the index it tracks . However , ETNs do not pay any interest payments like a bond .
--------------------------
Exchange - Traded Notes Explained . When the ETN matures , the financial institution takes out fees , then gives the investor cash based on the performance of the underlying index . Since ETNs trade on major exchanges like stocks , investors can buy and sell ETNs and make money from the difference between the purchase and sale prices minus any fees .
--------------------------
Exchange - Traded Notes Explained . ETNs are different than exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) . ETFs own the securities in the index they track . For example , an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 will own all 500 stocks in the S&P.
--------------------------
Exchange - Traded Notes Explained . ETNs do not provide investors ownership of the securities but are merely paid the return that the index produces . As a result , ETNs are similar to debt securities . The investors must trust that the issuer will make good on the return based on the underlying index .
--------------------------
Exchange - Traded Notes Explained . ETNs were first issued by Barclays Bank PLC . Banks and other financial institutions typically issue ETNs at $ 50 per share . Part of the market price depends on how the underlying index is performing .
--------------------------
Risk From an ETN Issuer . The repayment of the principal invested depends , in part , on the performance of the underlying index . If the index either goes down or does not go up enough to cover the fees involved in the transaction , the investor will receive a lower amount at maturity than what was originally invested .
--------------------------
Risk From an ETN Issuer . The ETNs ability to pay back the principal — plus gains from the index it tracks — depends on the financial viability of the issuer . As a result , an ETN 's value is impacted by the credit rating of the issuer . The value of the ETN could decline due to a downgrade in the issuer 's credit rating , even though there was no change in the underlying index .
--------------------------
Risk From an ETN Issuer . Investors must be aware of the risks that the issuer of an ETN may be unable to repay the principal and default on the bond . Also , political , economic , legal , or regulatory changes may affect the financial institution 's ability to pay ETN investors on time .
--------------------------
Risk From an ETN Issuer . The financial institution issuing the ETN might use options to achieve the return from the index , which can increase the risk of losses to investors . Options are agreements that can magnify gains or losses where the issuer has the right to transact shares of stocks by paying a premium in the options market . Options are usually short - term contracts , and the premiums can fluctuate wildly based on market conditions .
--------------------------
Risk From an ETN Issuer . Investors also have closure risk meaning the issuer might be able to close the ETN before maturity . In this case , the investor would be paid the prevailing price in the market . If the sale price is lower than the purchase price , the investor can realize a loss . The early redemption feature of an ETN is stated up front .
--------------------------
Risk in Tracking an Index . The price of the ETN should track the index closely , but there can be times when it does not correlate well — called tracking errors . Tracking errors happen if there are credit issues with the issuer and the price of the ETN deviates from the underlying index .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . If a financial institution decides not to issue new ETNs for a period , prices of existing ETNs could jump significantly due to the lack of supply . As a result , existing ETNs could trade at a premium to the value of the index it tracks . Conversely , if the bank suddenly decides to issue additional ETNs , prices of existing ETNs could fall due to excess supply .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . Trading activity for ETNs can be low or fluctuate dramatically . The result can be ETN prices that are trading at far higher prices than their actual value for those looking to buy . Also , these products may sell at far lower prices than their value for investors looking to sell . Due to the varying prices of ETNs , investors who sell an ETN before maturity can realize a large loss or gain .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . ETN investors earn profit if the underlying index is higher at maturity .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . Investors do n't need to own the underlying securities of the index they track .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . Exchange - traded notes trade on major exchanges .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . Exchange - traded notes do n't make regular interest payments .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . ETNs have default risk since the repayment of principal is contingent on the issuer 's financial viability .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . Trading volume can be low causing ETN prices to trade at a premium .
--------------------------
Risks From Liquidity . Tracking errors can occur if the ETN does n't track the underlying index closely .
--------------------------
Tax Treatment of ETNs . Typically , the difference between the purchase price and selling price of the ETN should be treated as a capital gain or loss for income tax purposes . The investor may defer the gain until the ETN is sold or matures . However , investors should seek counsel from a tax professional for any potential tax ramifications that might exist for their specific situation .
--------------------------
Real World Example of an ETN . The JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN ( AMJ ) is an energy infrastructure ETN . It tracks companies in the energy sector that are master limited partnerships ( MLPs ) . MLPs are publicly - traded partnerships some of which are responsible for building the energy infrastructure in the U.S.
--------------------------
Real World Example of an ETN . AMJ has over $ 3 billion in assets and an expense ratio of 0.85 % . Over the past five years , the ETN has traded between $ 50 and $ 22 per share .
--------------------------
Real World Example of an ETN . It is important that investors consider the risks present with ETNs . These risks include not only the credit risk of the issuer but also the risk that the ETN 's share price could decline significantly as in the case of AMJ .
