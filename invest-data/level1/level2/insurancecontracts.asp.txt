How to Easily Understand Your Insurance Contract . Almost all of us have insurance . When your insurer gives you the policy document , generally , all you do is glance over the decorated words in the policy and pile it up with the other bunch of financial papers on your desk , right ? If you spend thousands of dollars each year on insurance , do n't you think that you should know all about it ? Your insurance advisor is always there for you to help you understand the tricky terms in the insurance forms , but you should also know for yourself what your contract says . In this article , we 'll make reading your insurance contract easy , so you understand their basic principles and how they are put to use in daily life .
--------------------------
Contract Values . Most insurance contracts are indemnity contracts . Indemnity contracts apply to insurances where the loss suffered can be measured in terms of money .
--------------------------
Contract Values . ( To read more on indemnity contracts , see " Shopping for Car Insurance " and " How Does the 80 % Rule for Home Insurance Work ? " )
--------------------------
Contract Values . There are some additional factors of your insurance contract that create situations in which the full value of an insured asset is not remunerated .
--------------------------
Contract Values . Not all insurance contracts are indemnity contracts . Life insurance contracts and most personal accident insurance contracts are non - indemnity contracts . You may purchase a life insurance policy of $ 1 million , but that does not imply that your life 's value is equal to this dollar amount . Because you ca n't calculate your life 's net worth and fix a price on it , an indemnity contract does not apply .

--------------------------
Insurable Interest . It is your legal right to insure any type of property or any event that may cause financial loss or create legal liability for you . This is called insurable interest .
--------------------------
Insurable Interest . Suppose you are living in your uncle 's house , and you apply for homeowners ' insurance because you believe that you may inherit the house later . Insurers will decline your offer because you are not the owner of the house and , therefore , you do not stand to suffer financially in the event of a loss . When it comes to insurance , it is not the house , car or machinery that is insured . Rather , it is the monetary interest in that house , car or machinery to which your policy applies .
--------------------------
Insurable Interest . It is also the principle of insurable interest that allows married couples to take out insurance policies on each other 's lives , on the principle that one may suffer financially if the spouse dies . Insurable interest also exists in some business arrangements , as seen between a creditor and debtor , between business partners or between employers and employees .
--------------------------
Principle of Subrogation . Subrogation allows an insurer to sue a third party that has caused a loss to the insured and pursues all methods of getting back some of the money that it has paid to the insured as a result of the loss .
--------------------------
Principle of Subrogation . For example , if you are injured in a road accident that is caused by the reckless driving of another party , you will be compensated by your insurer . However , your insurance company may also sue the reckless driver in an attempt to recover that money .
--------------------------
The Doctrine of Good Faith . All insurance contracts are based on the concept of uberrima fidei , or the doctrine of utmost good faith . This doctrine emphasizes the presence of mutual faith between the insured and the insurer . In simple terms , while applying for insurance , it becomes your duty to disclose your relevant facts and information truthfully to the insurer . Likewise , the insurer can not hide information about the insurance coverage that is being sold .
--------------------------
The Doctrine of Good Faith . As we 've already mentioned , insurance works on the principle of mutual trust . It is your responsibility to disclose all the relevant facts to your insurer . Normally , a breach of the principle of utmost good faith arises when you , whether deliberately or accidentally , fail to divulge these important facts . There are two kinds of non - disclosure :
--------------------------
The Doctrine of Good Faith . For example , suppose that you are unaware that your grandfather died from cancer and , therefore , you did not disclose this material fact in the family history questionnaire when applying for life insurance ; this is innocent non - disclosure . However , if you knew about this material fact and purposely held it back from the insurer , you are guilty of fraudulent non - disclosure .
--------------------------
The Doctrine of Good Faith . When you supply inaccurate information with the intention to deceive , your insurance contract becomes void .
--------------------------
Other Policy Aspects . The Doctrine of Adhesion . The doctrine of adhesion states that you must accept the entire insurance contract and all of its terms and conditions without bargaining . Because the insured has no opportunity to change the terms , any ambiguities in the contract will be interpreted in his or her favor .
--------------------------
Other Policy Aspects . Principle of Waiver and Estoppel . A waiver is a voluntary surrender of a known right . Estoppel prevents a person from asserting those rights because he or she has acted in such a way as to deny interest in preserving those rights . Presume that you fail to disclose some information in the insurance proposal form . Your insurer does n't request that information and issues the insurance policy . This is a waiver . In the future , when a claim arises , your insurer can not question the contract on the basis of non - disclosure . This is estoppel . For this reason , your insurer will have to pay the claim .
--------------------------
Other Policy Aspects . Endorsements are normally used when the terms of insurance contracts are to be altered . They could also be issued to add specific conditions to the policy .
--------------------------
Other Policy Aspects . Co - insurance refers to the sharing of insurance by two or more insurance companies in an agreed proportion . For the insurance of a large shopping mall , for example , the risk is very high . Therefore , the insurance company may choose to involve two or more insurers to share the risk . Coinsurance can also exist between you and your insurance company . This provision is quite popular in medical insurance , in which you and the insurance company decide to share the covered costs in the ratio of 20:80 . Therefore , during the claim , your insurer will pay 80 % of the covered loss while you shell out the remaining 20 % .
--------------------------
Other Policy Aspects . Reinsurance occurs when your insurer " sells " some of your coverage to another insurance company . Suppose you are a famous rock star and you want your voice to be insured for $ 50 million . Your offer is accepted by the Insurance Company A. However , Insurance Company A is unable to retain the entire risk , so it passes part of this risk – let 's say $ 40 million – to Insurance Company B. Should you lose your singing voice , you will receive $ 50 million from insurer A ( $ 10 million + $ 40 million ) with insurer B contributing the reinsured amount ( $ 40 million ) to insurer A. This practice is known as reinsurance . Generally , reinsurance is practiced to a much greater extent by general insurers than life insurers .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . When applying for insurance , you will find a huge range of insurance products available in the market . If you have an insurance advisor , he or she can shop around and make sure that you are getting adequate insurance coverage for your money . Even so , a little understanding of insurance contracts can go a long way in making sure that your advisor 's recommendations are on track .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . Furthermore , there may be times when your claim is canceled because you did n't pay attention to certain information requested by your insurance company . In this case , a lack of knowledge and carelessness can cost you a lot . Go through your insurer 's policy features instead of signing them without delving into the fine print . If you understand what you 're reading , you 'll be able to ensure that the insurance product that you are signing up for will cover you when you need it most .
