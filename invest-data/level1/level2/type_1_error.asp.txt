Type I Error . A type I error is a kind of fault that occurs during the hypothesis testing process when a null hypothesis is rejected , even though it is accurate and should not be rejected . In hypothesis testing , a null hypothesis is established before the onset of a test . In some cases , the null hypothesis assumes the absence of a cause and effect relationship between the item being tested and the stimuli being applied to the test subject to trigger an outcome to the test .
--------------------------
Type I Error . This condition is denoted as " n=0 . " If — when the test is conducted — the result seems to indicate that the stimuli applied to the test subject cause a reaction then the null hypothesis that the stimuli do not affect the test subject will be rejected .
--------------------------
False Positive Type I Error . Sometimes , rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the test subject , the stimuli , and the outcome can be incorrect . If something other than the stimuli causes the outcome of the test , it can cause a " false positive " result where it appears the stimuli acted upon the subject , but the outcome was caused by chance . This " false positive , " leading to an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis , is called a type I error . A type I error rejects an idea that should not have been rejected .
--------------------------
Example of a Type I Error . For example , let 's look at the trail of an accused criminal . The null hypothesis is that the person is innocent , while the alternative is guilty . A Type I error in this case would mean that the person is not found innocent and is sent to jail , despite actually being innocent .
--------------------------
Example of a Type I Error . In medical testing , a type I error would cause the appearance that a treatment for a disease has the effect of reducing the severity of the disease when , in fact , it does not . When a new medicine is being tested , the null hypothesis will be that the medicine does not affect the progression of the disease . Let 's say a lab is researching a new cancer drug . Their null hypothesis might be that the drug does not affect the growth rate of cancer cells .
--------------------------
Example of a Type I Error . After applying the drug to the cancer cells , the cancer cells stop growing . This would cause the researchers to reject their null hypothesis that the drug would have no effect . If the drug caused the growth stoppage , the conclusion to reject the null , in this case , would be correct . However , if something else during the test caused the growth stoppage instead of the administered drug , this would be an example of an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis , i.e. , a type I error .
