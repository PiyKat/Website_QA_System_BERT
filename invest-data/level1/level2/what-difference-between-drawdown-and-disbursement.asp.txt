Drawdown vs. Disbursement : What 's the Difference ? . The terms drawdown and disbursement have multiple meanings in the finance world , although they are different things altogether . Drawdowns usually have to do with the reception of funds from either a retirement account , bank loan , or money deposited into an individual account . Disbursements refer to either cash outflows , dividend payments , purchases from an investment account , or spending cash .

A Closer Look at Drawdowns . A retirement account commonly has a " drawdown percentage " that represents the part of the total account balance that retiree has assumed each year . A drawdown usually causes a peak - to - trough decline period for an investment , trading account , or fund , and it is often quoted as the percentage between the peak and the trough that follows .

A Closer Look at Drawdowns . For example , if a trading account has $ 1,000 in it , and the funds drop to $ 900 before rising back to $ 1,000 or higher , the trading account is said to have seen a 10 % drawdown .

A Closer Look at Drawdowns .

In this sense , a drawdown is the extent of an asset 's price decline between its peak and trough .

A Closer Look at Drawdowns . When we look at the uptick in share price needed to offset a drawdown , drawdowns can actually be risky for investors . For example , a 1 % stock loss only needs a 1.01 % rise to recover to its previous peak , but a drawdown of 20 % needs a 25 % return to reach the old peak . During the 2008–2009 Great Recession , 50 % drawdowns became common ; these had to see massive 100 % increases to recover the former peaks .

A Closer Look at Disbursements . Disbursements may differ from actual profit or loss ; they measure the money flowing out of a business . Companies that use the accrual method of accounting record or report expenses as they occur , but not necessarily when they are paid . This method reports income when it is earned , as well — not when it is received . In this way , managers use ledgers to see how much cash has been disbursed , tracking the use of cash to determine their companies ' spending ratios .
