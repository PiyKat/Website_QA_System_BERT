What Is a Market Index ? . A market index is a hypothetical portfolio of investment holdings which represents a segment of the financial market . The calculation of the index value comes from the prices of the underlying holdings . Some indices have values based on market - cap weighting , revenue - weighting , float - weighting , and fundamental - weighting . Weighting is a method of adjusting the individual impact of items in an index .
--------------------------
What Is a Market Index ? . Investors follow different market indexes to gauge market movements . The three most popular stock indexes for tracking the performance of the U.S. market are the Dow Jones , S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite . In the bond market , Bloomberg Barclays is a leading provider of market indexes with the U.S. Aggregate Bond Market Index serving as one of the most popular proxies for U.S. bonds . Investors can not invest directly in an index , so these portfolios are used broadly as benchmarks or for developing index funds .
--------------------------
Understanding Market Indexes . Market indices measure the value of a portfolio of holdings with specific market characteristics . Each index has its own methodology which is calculated and maintained by the index provider . Index methodologies will typically be weighted by either price or market cap . A wide variety of investors use market indices for following the financial markets and managing their investment portfolios . Indexes are deeply entrenched in the investment management business with funds using them as benchmarks for performance comparisons and managers using them as the basis for creating investable index funds .
--------------------------
Index Methodologies . Each individual index has its own method for calculating the index ’s value . Weighted average mathematics is primarily the basis for index calculations as values are derived from a weighted average calculation of the value of the total portfolio . As such , price - weighted indexes will be more greatly impacted by changes in holdings with the highest price , market cap weighted indexes will be most greatly impacted by changes in the largest stocks , and so on depending on the weighting characteristics .
--------------------------
Indexes as Benchmarks . As a hypothetical portfolio of holdings , indexes act as benchmark comparisons for a variety of purposes across the financial markets . As mentioned , the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are three popular U.S. indices . These three indexes include the 30 largest stocks in the U.S. by market cap , the 500 largest stocks and all of the stocks on the Nasdaq exchange , respectively . Since they include some of the most significant U.S. stocks , these benchmarks can be a good representation of the overall U.S. stock market .
--------------------------
Indexes as Benchmarks . Other indexes have more specific characteristics that create a more narrowly targeted market focus . Indexes can represent micro - sectors or maturity in the case of fixed income . Indexes can also be created to represent a geographic segment of the market such as those that track the emerging markets or stocks in the United Kingdom and Europe , such as the FTSE 100 .
--------------------------
Indexes as Benchmarks . Investors may choose to build a portfolio with diversified exposure to several indexes or individual holdings from a variety of indexes . They may also use benchmark values and performance to follow investments by segment . Some investors will allocate their investment portfolios based on the returns or expected returns of certain segments . Further , a specific index may act as a benchmark for a portfolio or a mutual fund .
--------------------------
Index Funds . Institutional fund managers use benchmarks as a proxy for a fund ’s individual performance . Each fund has a benchmark discussed in its prospectus and provided in its performance reporting which offers transparency to investors . Fund benchmarks can also be used to evaluate the compensation and performance of fund managers .

July 3 , 1884 . Institutional fund managers also use indexes as a basis for creating index funds . Individual investors can not invest in an index without buying each of the individual holdings which is generally too expensive from a trading perspective . Therefore , index funds are offered as a low - cost way for investors to invest in a comprehensive index portfolio , gaining exposure to a specific market segment of their choosing . Index funds use an index replication strategy which buys and holds all of the constituents in an index . Some management and trading costs are still included in the fund ’s expense ratio but the costs are much lower than fees for an actively managed fund .

Real World Examples . Investors often choose to use index investing over individual stock holdings in a diversified portfolio . Investing in a portfolio of indexes can be a good way to optimize returns while balancing risk . For example , an investor seeking to build a balanced portfolio of U.S. stocks and bonds could choose to invest 50 % of their funds in an S&P 500 ETF and 50 % in a U.S. Aggregate Bond Index ETF .
