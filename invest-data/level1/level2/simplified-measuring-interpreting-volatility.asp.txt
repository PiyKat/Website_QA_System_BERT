Calculating volatility : A simplified approach . Many investors have experienced abnormal levels of investment performance volatility during various periods of the market cycle . While volatility may be greater than anticipated at times , a case can also be made that the manner in which volatility is typically measured contributes to the problem of stocks seeming unexpectedly , unaccountably volatile .
--------------------------
Calculating volatility : A simplified approach . The purpose of this article is to discuss the issues associated with the traditional measure of volatility , and to explain a more intuitive approach that investors can use in order to help them evaluate the magnitude of risks .
--------------------------
Traditional Measure of Volatility . Most investors know that standard deviation is the typical statistic used to measure volatility . Standard deviation is simply defined as the square root of the average variance of the data from its mean . While this statistic is relatively easy to calculate , the assumptions behind its interpretation are more complex , which in turn raises concern about its accuracy . As a result , there is a certain level of skepticism surrounding its validity as an accurate measure of risk .
--------------------------
Traditional Measure of Volatility . In order for standard deviation to be an accurate measure of risk , an assumption has to be made that investment performance data follows a normal distribution . In graphical terms , a normal distribution of data will plot on a chart in a manner that looks like a bell - shaped curve . If this standard holds true , then approximately 68 % of the expected outcomes should lie between ±1 standard deviations from the investment 's expected return , 95 % should lie between ±2 standard deviations , and 99.7 % should lie between ±3 standard deviations .
--------------------------
Traditional Measure of Volatility . For example , during the period of June 1 , 1979 , through June 1 , 2009 , the three - year rolling annualized average performance of the S&P 500 Index was 9.5 % , and its standard deviation was 10 % . Given these baseline parameters of performance , one would expect that 68 % of the time the expected performance of the S&P 500 index would fall within a range of -0.5 % and 19.5 % ( 9.5 % ±10 % ) .
--------------------------
Traditional Measure of Volatility . Unfortunately , there are three main reasons why investment performance data may not be normally distributed . First , investment performance is typically skewed , which means that return distributions are typically asymmetrical . As a result , investors tend to experience abnormally high and low periods of performance . Second , investment performance typically exhibits a property known as kurtosis , which means that investment performance exhibits an abnormally large number of positive and/or negative periods of performance . Taken together , these problems warp the look of the bell - shaped curve , and distort the accuracy of standard deviation as a measure of risk .
--------------------------
Traditional Measure of Volatility . In addition to skewness and kurtosis , a problem known as heteroskedasticity is also a cause for concern . Heteroskedasticity simply means that the variance of the sample investment performance data is not constant over time . As a result , standard deviation tends to fluctuate based on the length of the time period used to make the calculation , or the period of time selected to make the calculation .
--------------------------
Traditional Measure of Volatility . Like skewness and kurtosis , the ramifications of heteroskedasticity will cause standard deviation to be an unreliable measure of risk . Taken collectively , these three problems can cause investors to misunderstand the potential volatility of their investments , and cause them to potentially take much more risk than anticipated .
--------------------------
A Simplified Measure of Volatility . Fortunately , there is a much easier and more accurate way to measure and examine risk , through a process known as the historical method . To utilize this method , investors simply need to graph the historical performance of their investments , by generating a chart known as a histogram .
--------------------------
A Simplified Measure of Volatility . A histogram is a chart that plots the proportion of observations that fall within a host of category ranges . For example , in the chart below , the three - year rolling annualized average performance of the S&P 500 Index for the period of June 1 , 1979 , through June 1 , 2009 , has been constructed . The vertical axis represents the magnitude of the performance of the S&P 500 Index , and the horizontal axis represents the frequency in which the S&P 500 Index experienced such performance .

A Simplified Measure of Volatility . As the chart illustrates , the use of a histogram allows investors to determine the percent of time in which the performance of an investment is within , above , or below a given range . For example , 16 % of the S&P 500 Index performance observations achieved a return between 9 % and 11.7 % . In terms of performance below or above a threshold , it can also be determined that the S&P 500 Index experienced a loss greater than or equal to 1.1 % , 16 % of the time , and performance above 24.8 % , 7.7 % of the time .
--------------------------
Comparing the Methods . The use of the historical method via a histogram has three main advantages over the use of standard deviation . First , the historical method does not require that investment performance be normally distributed . Second , the impact of skewness and kurtosis is explicitly captured in the histogram chart , which provides investors with the necessary information to mitigate unexpected volatility surprise . Third , investors can examine the magnitude of gains and losses experienced .
--------------------------
Comparing the Methods . The only drawback to the historical method is that the histogram , like the use of standard deviation , suffers from the potential impact of heteroskedasticity . However , this should not be a surprise , as investors should understand that past performance is not indicative of future returns . In any event , even with this one caveat , the historical method still serves as an excellent baseline measure of investment risk , and should be used by investors for evaluating the magnitude and frequency of their potential gains and losses associated with their investment opportunities .
--------------------------
Application of the Methodology . How do investors generate a histogram in order to help them examine the risk attributes of their investments ?
--------------------------
Application of the Methodology . One recommendation is to request the investment performance information from the investment management firms . However , the necessary information can also be obtained by gathering the monthly closing price of the investment asset , typically found through various sources , and then manually calculating investment performance .
--------------------------
Application of the Methodology . After performance information has been gathered , or manually calculated , a histogram can be constructed by importing the data into a software package , such as Microsoft Excel , and using the software 's data analysis add - on feature . By utilizing this methodology , investors should be able to easily generate a histogram , which in turn should help them gauge the true volatility of their investment opportunities .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . In practical terms , the utilization of a histogram should allow investors to examine the risk of their investments in a manner that will help them gauge the amount of money they stand to make or lose on an annual basis . Given this type of real - world applicability , investors should be less surprised when the markets fluctuate dramatically , and therefore they should feel much more content with their investment exposure during all economic environments .
