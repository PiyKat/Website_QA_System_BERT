What is Disposable Income . Disposable income , also known as disposable personal income ( DPI ) , is the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after income taxes have been accounted for . Disposable personal income is often monitored as one of the many key economic indicators used to gauge the overall state of the economy .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Disposable Income . Disposable income is an important measure of household financial resources . For example , consider a family with a household income of $ 100,000 , and the family has an effective income tax rate of 25 % ( versus marginal tax rate ) . This household 's disposable income would then be $ 75,000 ( $ 100,000 - $ 25,000 ) . Economists use DPI as a starting point to gauge households ' rates of savings and spending .

Statistical Uses of Disposable Income . Many useful statistical measures and economic indicators derive from disposable income . For example , economists use disposable income as a starting point to calculate metrics such as discretionary income , personal savings rates , marginal propensity to consume ( MPC ) , and marginal propensity to save ( MPS ) .
--------------------------
Statistical Uses of Disposable Income . Disposable income minus all payments for necessities ( mortgage , health insurance , food , transportation ) equals discretionary income . This portion of disposable income can be spent on what the income earner chooses or , alternatively , it can be saved . Discretionary income is the first to shrink amid a job loss , pay reduction , or economic downturn . As such , businesses that sell discretionary goods tend to suffer the most during recessions and are watched closely by economists for signs of both recession and recovery .

Statistical Uses of Disposable Income . The personal savings rate is the percentage of disposable income that goes into savings for retirement or use at a later date . Marginal propensity to consume represents the percentage of each additional dollar of disposable income that gets spent , while marginal propensity to save denotes the percentage that gets saved .
--------------------------
Statistical Uses of Disposable Income . For several months in 2005 , the average personal savings rate dipped into negative territory for the first time since 1933 . This means that in 2005 , Americans were spending all of their disposable income each month and then tapping into savings or debt for further spending .

Disposable Income for Wage Garnishment . The federal government uses a slightly different method to calculate disposable income for wage garnishment purposes . Sometimes , the government garnishes an income earner 's wages for payment of back taxes or delinquent child support . It uses disposable income as a starting point to determine how much to seize from the earner 's paycheck . As of 2019 , the amount garnished may not exceed 25 % of a person 's disposable income or the amount by which a person 's weekly income exceeds 30 times the federal minimum wage , whichever is less .
--------------------------
Disposable Income for Wage Garnishment . In addition to income taxes , the government subtracts health insurance premiums and involuntary retirement plan contributions from gross income when calculating disposable income for wage garnishment purposes . Returning to the above example , if the family described pays $ 10,000 per year in health insurance premiums and is required to contribute $ 5,000 to a retirement plan , its disposable income for wage garnishment purposes shrinks from $ 75,000 to $ 60,000 .
