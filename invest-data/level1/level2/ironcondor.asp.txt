What Is an Iron Condor ? . An iron condor is an options strategy created with four options consisting of two puts ( one long and one short ) and two calls ( one long and one short ) , and four strike prices , all with the same expiration date . The goal is to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset . In other words , the iron condor earns the maximum profit when the underlying asset closes between the middle strike prices at expiration .
--------------------------
What Is an Iron Condor ? . The iron condor has a similar payoff as a regular condor spread , but uses both calls and puts instead of only calls or only puts . Both the condor and the iron condor are extensions of the butterfly spread and iron butterfly , respectively .
--------------------------
Understanding the Iron Condor . The strategy has limited upside and downside risk because the high and low strike options , the wings , protect against significant moves in either direction . Because of this limited risk , its profit potential is also limited . The commission can be a notable factor here , as there are four options involved .
--------------------------
Understanding the Iron Condor . For this strategy , the trader ideally would like all of the options to expire worthlessly , which is only possible if the underlying asset closes between the middle two strike prices at expiration . There will likely be a fee to close the trade if it is successful . If it is not successful , the loss is still limited .
--------------------------
. One way to think of an iron condor is having a long strangle inside of a larger , short strangle ( or vice - versa ) .
--------------------------
. The construction of the strategy is as follows :
--------------------------
. The options that are further out of the money , called the wings , are both long positions . Because both of these options are further out of the money , their premiums are lower than the two written options , so there is a net credit to the account when placing the trade .
--------------------------
. By selecting different strike prices , it is possible to make the strategy lean bullish or bearish . For example , if both the middle strike prices are above the current price of the underlying asset , the trader hopes for a small rise in its price by expiration . It still has limited reward and limited risk .
--------------------------
Iron Condor Profits and Losses . The maximum profit for an iron condor is the amount of premium , or credit , received for creating the four - leg options position .
--------------------------
Iron Condor Profits and Losses . The maximum loss is also capped . The maximum loss is the difference between the long call and short call strikes , or the long put and short put strikes . Reduce the loss by the net credits received , but then add commissions to get the total loss for the trade .
--------------------------
Iron Condor Profits and Losses . The maximum loss occurs if the price moves above the long call strike ( which is higher than the sold call strike ) or below the long put strike ( which is lower than the sold put strike ) .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . Assume that an investor believes Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) will be relatively flat in terms of price over the next two months . They decide to implement an iron condor . The stock is currently trading at $ 212.26 .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . They sell a call with a $ 215 strike , which gives them $ 7.63 in premium . They buy a call with a strike of $ 220 , which costs them $ 5.35 . The credit on these two legs is $ 2.28 , or $ 228 for one contract ( 100 shares ) . The trade is only half complete , though .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . In addition , the trader sells a put with a strike of $ 210 , resulting in a premium received of $ 7.20 . They also buy a put with a strike of $ 205 , costing $ 5.52 . The net credit on these two legs is $ 1.68 or $ 168 if trading one contract on each .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . The total credit for the position is $ 3.96 ( $ 2.28 + $ 1.68 ) , or $ 396 . This is the maximum profit the trader can make . This maximum profit occurs if all the options expire worthless , which means the price must be between $ 215 and $ 210 when expiration occurs in two months . If the price is above $ 215 or below $ 210 , the trader could still make a reduced profit , but could also lose money .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . The loss gets larger if the price of Apple stock approaches the upper call strike ( $ 220 ) or the lower put strike ( $ 205 ) . The maximum loss occurs if the price of the stock trades above $ 220 or below $ 205 .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . Assume the stock at expiration is $ 225 . This is above the upper call strike price , which means the trader is facing the maximum possible loss . The sold call is losing $ 10 ( $ 225 - $ 215 ) while the bought call is making $ 5 ( $ 225 - $ 220 ) . The puts expire . The trader loses $ 5 , or $ 500 total ( 100 share contracts ) , but they also received $ 396 in premiums . Therefore , the loss is capped at $ 104 plus commissions .
--------------------------
Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . Now assume the price of Apple instead dropped , but not below the lower put threshold . It falls to $ 208 . The short call is losing $ 2 ( $ 208 - $ 210 ) , or $ 200 , while the long put expires worthless . The calls also expire . The trader loses $ 200 on the position but received $ 396 in premium credits . Therefore , they still make $ 196 , less commission costs .
