What Does Standard Deviation Measure In a Portfolio ? . Standard deviation is a mathematical measurement of average variance . It is a prominent feature in statistics , economics , accounting , and finance . For a given data set , the standard deviation measures how spread out numbers are from an average value . Standard deviation can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance , which itself is the average of the squared differences of the mean .

What Does Standard Deviation Measure In a Portfolio ? . When it comes to mutual fund or hedge fund investing , analysts look to standard deviation more than any other risk measurement . By taking the standard deviation of a portfolio 's annual rate of return , analysts can better measure the consistency with which returns are generated . Mutual funds with a long track record of consistent returns display a low standard deviation . Growth - oriented or emerging market funds , however , are likely to see more volatility and to have a higher standard deviation . They also , therefore , carry more risk .
--------------------------
The Consistency of Standard Deviation . One of the reasons for the widespread popularity of standard deviation measurements is their consistency . Not only does one standard deviation from the mean represent the same thing whether you are talking about gross domestic product ( GDP ) , crop yields , or the height of dogs , it is always calculated in the same units as the data set . You never have to interpret an additional unit of measurement resulting from the formula .
--------------------------
The Consistency of Standard Deviation . For example , suppose a mutual fund achieves the following annual rates of return over the course of five years : 4 percent , 6 percent , 8.5 percent , 2 percent , and 4 percent . The mean value , or average , is 4.9 percent . The standard deviation is 2.46 percent , which means that each individual yearly value is an average of 2.46 percent away from the mean . Every value is expressed in a percentage and , now , the relative volatility is easier to compare among similar mutual funds .
--------------------------
The Consistency of Standard Deviation . Due to its consistent mathematical properties , 68 percent of the values in any data set lie within one standard deviation of the mean , and 95 percent lie within two standard deviations of the mean . Alternatively , you can estimate with 95 percent certainty that annual returns do not exceed the range created within two standard deviations of the mean .
--------------------------
Bollinger Bands . In investing , standard deviations are chiefly used under the guise of Bollinger bands . Developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s , Bollinger bands are a series of lines that can help identify trends in a given security . At the center is the exponential moving average ( EMA ) , which reflects the average price of the security over an established time frame . To either side of this line are bands set one to three standard deviations away from the mean . These outer bands oscillate with the moving average according to changing price action .
--------------------------
Bollinger Bands . In addition to numerous other useful applications , Bollinger Bands are used as an indicator of market volatility . When a security has experienced a period of great volatility , the bands are quite wide . As volatility decreases , the bands narrow , hugging closer to the EMA . Even the most range - bound charts experience brief spurts of volatility from time to time , after earnings reports or product releases , for example . In these charts , normally narrow Bollinger bands suddenly bubble out to accommodate the spike in activity . Once things settle again , the bands narrow . Because many investment techniques are dependent on changing trends , being able to identify highly volatile stocks at a glance can be an especially useful tool .
--------------------------
Other Data to Consider . While important , standard deviations should not be taken as an end - all measurement of the worth of an individual investment or a portfolio . For example , a mutual fund that returns between 5 percent and 7 percent every single year has a lower standard deviation than a competing fund that returns between 6 percent and 16 percent every year , but it is clearly an inferior choice with all other things being equal .
--------------------------
Other Data to Consider . It is important to note that standard deviation only shows the dispersion of annual returns for a mutual fund , which does not necessarily imply future consistency with this measurement . Economic factors such as interest rate changes can always affect the performance of a mutual fund . When assessing risk associated with a mutual fund , standard deviation is not a standalone answer . For example , standard deviation only shows consistency or inconsistency of returns but does not show how well the fund performs against its benchmark , which is measured as beta .
--------------------------
Other Data to Consider . Another potential weakness of relying on standard deviation to measure risk for a portfolio is that it assumes a bell - shaped distribution of data values . This means the equation indicates that the same probability exists for achieving values above the mean or below the mean . Many portfolios do not display this tendency , and hedge funds especially tend to be skewed in one direction or another .
--------------------------
Other Data to Consider . The more securities held in a portfolio , and the more variety in the different types of securities , the more likely standard deviation may not be appropriate . Also , as with any statistical model , large data sets are more reliable than small data sets . The 4.9 percent mean and 2.46 percent standard deviation in the example above is not as reliable as the same values produced from 50 different calculations instead of five .
