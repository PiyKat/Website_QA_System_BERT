DEFINITION of Limited Risk . Limited risk describes an investment that has a predetermined maximum downside potential , which is usually the initial amount invested . Investors can also manufacture a limited risk by purchasing securities that move in opposite directions .
--------------------------
BREAKING DOWN Limited Risk . Limited risk exposes investors to situations where they are aware , prior to entering the position , of the maximum level of loss they may suffer . A situation with unlimited risk would include selling naked shorts on a stock , where the potential for loss is infinite .
--------------------------
How Limited Risk Works : An Example . An investor might create an investment portfolio with X shares of Company Beta , which manufactures couches . The furniture industry is cyclical , so Company Beta will likely sell more couches during times of economic growth than it will during times when the economy is slow or contracting . Because of this , Company Beta ’s shares will decline in value during slow economic times . As an investor , you might want to protect your portfolio from this volatility , or limit your risk .
--------------------------
How Limited Risk Works : An Example . One way is to buy stocks that are not as sensitive to economic cycles . Sometimes called defensive stocks , they include food , utilities or other industries that sell products that consumers consider necessary . Theoretically , these stocks hold their value during economic downturns . The defensive stocks act as a bulwark , limiting the risk of holding shares of Company Beta .
--------------------------
How Limited Risk Works : An Example . Another way to limit the risk of an investment is to purchase a put option contract on the shares . Though costly , this would allow an investor to lock in a minimum price at which the shares could always be sold . An investor could also sell a futures contract , promising to sell the stock at a set price at a certain point in the future .
--------------------------
Why Investors Might Want to Limit Risk . Limited risk strategies help protect a portfolio against volatility . It can be especially attractive when an investor has experienced an extended period of gains and wants to lock in some of them . When choosing a limited risk investment , the investor is fully aware of the potential amount he or she could lose . For example , entering into a cash long position in a stock has limited risk because the investor can lose no more than the initial amount invested . Similarly , purchasing option contracts long has a limited risk , as only the initial premium paid for the option can be lost .
--------------------------
Why Investors Might Want to Limit Risk . Like all investment strategies , limiting one ’s risk requires a little planning . However , the security that this strategy provides could make it well worth the time and effort during a period of declining stock prices .
