How Do S&P 500 Futures Work ? . S&P 500 futures are a type of derivative contract that provides a buyer with an investment priced based on the expectation of the S&P 500 Index ’s future value . S&P 500 futures are closely followed by all types of investors and the financial media as an indicator of market movements . Investors can use S&P 500 futures to speculate on the future value of the S&P 500 by buying or selling futures contracts . Investors have two choices when seeking S&P 500 futures . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) offers an S&P 500 futures contract known as the ‘ big contract ’ with a ticker symbol of SP . It also offers an E - mini contract with a ticker symbol of ES .
--------------------------
Introduction to S&P 500 Futures . The CME introduced the first S&P 500 futures contracts in 1982 . The CME added the E - mini option in 1997 .
--------------------------
Introduction to S&P 500 Futures . The SP contract is the base market contract for S&P 500 futures trading . It is priced by multiplying the S&P 500 ’s value by $ 250 . For example , if the S&P 500 is at a level of 2,500 , then the market value of a futures contract is 2,500 x $ 250 or $ 625,000 .
--------------------------
Introduction to S&P 500 Futures . E - mini futures were created to allow for smaller investments by a wider range of investors . The S&P 500 E - Mini Futures are one - fifth the value of the big contract . If the S&P 500 level is 2,500 then the market value of a futures contract is 2,500 x $ 50 or $ 125,000 .
--------------------------
Introduction to S&P 500 Futures . The ‘ E ’ in E - mini stands for electronic . Many traders favor the S&P 500 E - Mini ES over the SP not only for its smaller investment size but also for its liquidity . Like its name , the E - Mini ES trades electronically which can be more efficient than the open outcry pit trading for the SP .
--------------------------
Introduction to S&P 500 Futures . Like with all futures , investors are only required to front a fraction of the contract value to take a position . This represents the margin on the futures contract . These margins are not the same as margins for stock trading . Futures margins show ‘ skin in the game ’ which must be offset or settled .
--------------------------
Cash Settlement of S&P 500 Futures . Industry experts created the cash settlement mechanism to resolve the massive logistical challenges presented by delivering the actual 500 stocks associated with an S&P 500 futures contract . Not only would the stocks have to be negotiated and transferred between holders , but they would have to be properly weighted to match their representation in the Index . Instead , an investor picks a long or short position , which is then subject to a mark - to - market . The investor pays any losses or receives profits each day in cash . Eventually , the contract expires , or is offset , and becomes cash - settled based on the spot value of the S&P 500 index .
--------------------------
Taking Bets . One of the often - proclaimed benefits of trading S&P 500 futures is each contract represents an immediate , indirect investment in the performance of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index . Investors can take long or short positions depending on their expectations for future prices . Large institutions may use S&P 500 futures to hedge positions in the S&P 500 Index . With this approach , futures are often used to offset downside risks . Many investors use S&P 500 futures for speculation as it tends to lead the market ’s major trends and is highly influenced by broad systematic factors .
--------------------------
Other Derivatives . In addition to basic futures contracts , the CME also offers derivatives in the form of options contracts on the S&P 500 . Just like with futures , S&P 500 options have a full value product and a mini . The full value product has a ticker symbol of SPX with a multiplier of $ 100 . The mini has a ticker symbol of XSP with a multiplier that is one - tenth the SPX . S&P 500 option contracts are also cash - settled .
