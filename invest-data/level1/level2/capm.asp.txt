What Is the Capital Asset Pricing Model ? . The Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets , particularly stocks . CAPM is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky securities and generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and cost of capital .
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . The formula for calculating the expected return of an asset given its risk is as follows :
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . ﻿ERi = Rf+βi(ERm−Rf)where : ERi = expected return of investmentRf = risk - free rateβi = beta of the investment(ERm−Rf)=market risk premium\begin{aligned } & ER_i = R_f + \beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\ & \textbf{where : } \\ & ER_i = \text{expected return of investment } \\ & R_f = \text{risk - free rate } \\ & \beta_i = \text{beta of the investment } \\ & ( ER_m - R_f ) = \text{market risk premium } \\ \end{aligned}​ERi​=Rf​+βi​(ERm​−Rf​)where : ERi​=expected return of investmentRf​=risk - free rateβi​=beta of the investment(ERm​−Rf​)=market risk premium​﻿
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the time value of money . The risk - free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money . The other components of the CAPM formula account for the investor taking on additional risk .
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . The beta of a potential investment is a measure of how much risk the investment will add to a portfolio that looks like the market . If a stock is riskier than the market , it will have a beta greater than one . If a stock has a beta of less than one , the formula assumes it will reduce the risk of a portfolio .
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . A stock ’s beta is then multiplied by the market risk premium , which is the return expected from the market above the risk - free rate . The risk - free rate is then added to the product of the stock ’s beta and the market risk premium . The result should give an investor the required return or discount rate they can use to find the value of an asset .
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . The goal of the CAPM formula is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared to its expected return .
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . For example , imagine an investor is contemplating a stock worth $ 100 per share today that pays a 3 % annual dividend . The stock has a beta compared to the market of 1.3 , which means it is riskier than a market portfolio . Also , assume that the risk - free rate is 3 % and this investor expects the market to rise in value by 8 % per year .
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . The expected return of the stock based on the CAPM formula is 9.5 % :
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . ﻿9.5%=3%+1.3×(8%−3%)\begin{aligned } & 9.5\% = 3\% + 1.3 \times ( 8\% - 3\% ) \\ \end{aligned}​9.5%=3%+1.3×(8%−3%)​﻿
--------------------------
Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) . The expected return of the CAPM formula is used to discount the expected dividends and capital appreciation of the stock over the expected holding period . If the discounted value of those future cash flows is equal to $ 100 then the CAPM formula indicates the stock is fairly valued relative to risk .
--------------------------
Problems With the CAPM . There are several assumptions behind the CAPM formula that have been shown not to hold in reality . Despite these issues , the CAPM formula is still widely used because it is simple and allows for easy comparisons of investment alternatives .
--------------------------
Problems With the CAPM . Including beta in the formula assumes that risk can be measured by a stock ’s price volatility . However , price movements in both directions are not equally risky . The look - back period to determine a stock ’s volatility is not standard because stock returns ( and risk ) are not normally distributed .
--------------------------
Problems With the CAPM . The CAPM also assumes that the risk - free rate will remain constant over the discounting period . Assume in the previous example that the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds rose to 5 % or 6 % during the 10-year holding period . An increase in the risk - free rate also increases the cost of the capital used in the investment and could make the stock look overvalued .
--------------------------
Problems With the CAPM . The market portfolio that is used to find the market risk premium is only a theoretical value and is not an asset that can be purchased or invested in as an alternative to the stock . Most of the time , investors will use a major stock index , like the S&P 500 , to substitute for the market , which is an imperfect comparison .
--------------------------
Problems With the CAPM . The most serious critique of the CAPM is the assumption that future cash flows can be estimated for the discounting process . If an investor could estimate the future return of a stock with a high level of accuracy , the CAPM would not be necessary .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . Using the CAPM to build a portfolio is supposed to help an investor manage their risk . If an investor were able to use the CAPM to perfectly optimize a portfolio ’s return relative to risk , it would exist on a curve called the efficient frontier , as shown on the following graph .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . The graph shows how greater expected returns ( y - axis ) require greater expected risk ( x - axis ) . Modern Portfolio Theory suggests that starting with the risk - free rate , the expected return of a portfolio increases as the risk increases . Any portfolio that fits on the Capital Market Line ( CML ) is better than any possible portfolio to the right of that line , but at some point , a theoretical portfolio can be constructed on the CML with the best return for the amount of risk being taken .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . The CML and efficient frontier may be difficult to define , but it illustrates an important concept for investors : there is a trade - off between increased return and increased risk . Because it is n’t possible to perfectly build a portfolio that fits on the CML , it is more common for investors to take on too much risk as they seek additional return .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . In the following chart , you can see two portfolios that have been constructed to fit along the efficient frontier . Portfolio A is expected to return 8 % per year and has a 10 % standard deviation or risk level . Portfolio B is expected to return 10 % per year but has a 16 % standard deviation . The risk of portfolio B rose faster than its expected returns .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . The efficient frontier assumes the same things as the CAPM and can only be calculated in theory . If a portfolio existed on the efficient frontier it would be providing the maximal return for its level of risk . However , it is impossible to know whether a portfolio exists on the efficient frontier or not because future returns can not be predicted .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . This trade - off between risk and return applies to the CAPM and the efficient frontier graph can be rearranged to illustrate the trade - off for individual assets . In the following chart , you can see that the CML is now called the Security Market Line ( SML ) . Instead of expected risk on the x - axis , the stock ’s beta is used . As you can see in the illustration , as beta increases from one to two , the expected return is also rising .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . The CAPM and SML make a connection between a stock ’s beta and its expected risk . A higher beta means more risk but a portfolio of high beta stocks could exist somewhere on the CML where the trade - off is acceptable , if not the theoretical ideal .
--------------------------
The CAPM and the Efficient Frontier . The value of these two models is diminished by assumptions about beta and market participants that are n’t true in the real markets . For example , beta does not account for the relative riskiness of a stock that is more volatile than the market with a high frequency of downside shocks compared to another stock with an equally high beta that does not experience the same kind of price movements to the downside .
--------------------------
Practical Value of the CAPM . Considering the critiques of the CAPM and the assumptions behind its use in portfolio construction , it might be difficult to see how it could be useful . However , using the CAPM as a tool to evaluate the reasonableness of future expectations or to conduct comparisons can still have some value .
--------------------------
Practical Value of the CAPM . Imagine an advisor who has proposed adding a stock to a portfolio with a $ 100 share price . The advisor uses the CAPM to justify the price with a discount rate of 13 % . The advisor ’s investment manager can take this information and compare it to the company ’s past performance and its peers to see if a 13 % return is a reasonable expectation .
--------------------------
Practical Value of the CAPM . Assume in this example that the peer group ’s performance over the last few years was a little better than 10 % while this stock had consistently underperformed with 9 % returns . The investment manager should n’t take the advisor ’s recommendation without some justification for the increased expected return .
--------------------------
Practical Value of the CAPM . An investor can also use the concepts from the CAPM and efficient frontier to evaluate their portfolio or individual stock performance compared to the rest of the market . For example , assume that an investor ’s portfolio has returned 10 % per year for the last three years with a standard deviation of returns ( risk ) of 10 % . However , the market averages have returned 10 % for the last three years with a risk of 8 % .
--------------------------
Practical Value of the CAPM . The investor could use this observation to reevaluate how their portfolio is constructed and which holdings may not be on the SML . This could explain why the investor ’s portfolio is to the right of the CML . If the holdings that are either dragging on returns or have increased the portfolio ’s risk disproportionately can be identified , the investor can make changes to improve returns .
--------------------------
Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM ) Summary . The CAPM uses the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory to determine if a security is fairly valued . It relies on assumptions about investor behaviors , risk and return distributions , and market fundamentals that do n’t match reality . However , the underlying concepts of CAPM and the associated efficient frontier can help investors understand the relationship between expected risk and reward as they make better decisions about adding securities to a portfolio .
