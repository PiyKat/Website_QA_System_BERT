What is Money Supply ? . The money supply is the entire stock of currency and other liquid instruments circulating in a country 's economy as of a particular time . The money supply can include cash , coins , and balances held in checking and savings accounts , and other near money substitutes . Economists analyze the money supply as a key variable to understanding the macroeconomy and guiding macroeconomic policy .
--------------------------
Understanding Money Supply . Economists analyze the money supply and develop policies revolving around it through controlling interest rates and increasing or decreasing the amount of money flowing in the economy . Public and private sector analysis is performed because of the money supply 's possible impacts on price level , inflation , and the business cycle . In the United States , the Federal Reserve policy is the most important deciding factor in the money supply . The money supply is also known as the money stock .
--------------------------
Effect of Money Supply on the Economy . An increase in the supply of money typically lowers interest rates , which in turn , generates more investment and puts more money in the hands of consumers , thereby stimulating spending . Businesses respond by ordering more raw materials and increasing production . The increased business activity raises the demand for labor . The opposite can occur if the money supply falls or when its growth rate declines .
--------------------------
Effect of Money Supply on the Economy . Change in the money supply has long been considered to be a key factor in driving macroeconomic performance and business cycles . Macroeconomic schools of thought that focus heavily on the role of money supply include Irving Fisher 's Quantity Theory of Money , Monetarism , and Austrian Business Cycle Theory .

Effect of Money Supply on the Economy . Historically , measuring the money supply has shown that relationships exist between it and inflation and price levels . However , since 2000 , these relationships have become unstable , reducing their reliability as a guide for monetary policy . Although money supply measures are still widely used , they are one of a wide array of economic data that economists and the Federal Reserve collects and reviews .
--------------------------
How Money Supply is Measured . The various types of money in the money supply are generally classified as Ms , such as M0 , M1 , M2 and M3 , according to the type and size of the account in which the instrument is kept . Not all of the classifications are widely used , and each country may use different classifications . The money supply reflects the different types of liquidity each type of money has in the economy . It is broken up into different categories of liquidity or spendability .
--------------------------
How Money Supply is Measured . M0 and M1 , for example , are also called narrow money and include coins and notes that are in circulation and other money equivalents that can be converted easily to cash . M2 includes M1 and , in addition , short - term time deposits in banks and certain money market funds . M3 includes M2 in addition to long - term deposits . However , M3 is no longer included in the reporting by the Federal Reserve . MZM , or money zero maturity , is a measure that includes financial assets with zero maturity and that are immediately redeemable at par . The Federal Reserve relies heavily on MZM data because its velocity is a proven indicator of inflation .
--------------------------
How Money Supply is Measured . Money supply data is collected , recorded and published periodically , typically by the country 's government or central bank . The Federal Reserve in the United States measures and publishes the total amount of M1 and M2 money supplies on a weekly and monthly basis . They can be found online and are also published in newspapers . According to data from the Federal Reserve , as of March 2019 a little over $ 3.7 trillion in M1 money was in circulation , while almost $ 14.5 trillion in M2 money was circulating in the United States .
