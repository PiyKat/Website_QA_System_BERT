S&P 500 vs. Russell 2000 ETF : An Overview . In his book , A Random Walk Down Wall Street , the Princeton professor Burton Malkiel writes :
--------------------------
S&P 500 vs. Russell 2000 ETF : An Overview . This idea is at the core of the debate between active vs. passive money management .
--------------------------
S&P 500 vs. Russell 2000 ETF : An Overview . If you find yourself on the conservative end of the active vs. passive spectrum , then investing in exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) may be one way to go . You may not beat the market , but you will certainly come close to matching it . In this article , we ’ll focus on ETFs that track two of the more popular indexes , the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 .
--------------------------
S&P 500 ETF . The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( S&P 500 ) is a market - capitalization , weighted index of some of the largest publicly traded U.S. corporations . Most analysts see the S&P 500 as the best indicator of the U.S. equity market . This index is a commonly used benchmark for many portfolio managers , mutual funds , and exchange - traded funds .
--------------------------
S&P 500 ETF . The three most commonly traded ETFs that track the performance of the S&P 500 index include :
--------------------------
S&P 500 ETF . The common theme between all three funds is , of course , the index they track — the S&P 500 . Many investors consider this index to be the pulse of the U.S. equity market . It is calculated using the market capitalizations of the 500 largest U.S. companies with stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) or the Nasdaq Stock Market . Index constituents are selected by a committee , which takes into account criteria such as market capitalization , liquidity , financial viability , length of trading , and other factors .
--------------------------
S&P 500 ETF . The oldest and the most widely held of the three ETFs is SPY . As of March 2019 , the fund had a net asset value of US$ 262.83 billion . The fund 's expenses come in at 0.09 % . While this expense is negligible in a broader asset management context , it is the highest among the three competitors . Even in spite of the higher expense , the fund has superior liquidity , with an average daily trading volume of 30 to 60 times that of IVV and VOO .
--------------------------
S&P 500 ETF . When comparing the performance numbers of the three — represented by net asset value ( NAV ) returns — all three slightly underperformed the S&P500 index over the last 10 years . VOO is the new kid on the block with a fund inception date of Sept. 9 , 2010 , so , it has fewer years of data for consideration . The SPY returned the lowest of the three funds . The lowered return is to be expected since it has the highest expense ratio among the three ETFs . Also , it must be understood that the funds are comparing to the virtually frictionless S&P 500 Index .
--------------------------
S&P 500 ETF . SPY is also structurally different from IVV and VOO in that it is set up as a unit investment trust ( UIT ) with restrictions on lending the underlying shares to other firms . Additionally , any dividends from SPY constituents for the period are collected and held in cash until distribution , whereas IVV and VOO allow for the reinvestment of dividends .
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . On the opposite side of the spectrum is the Russell 2000 Index that follows the performance of around 2,000 U.S. small - cap firms . Like the S&P , the index is weighted and regularly serves as a benchmark index .
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . As the name suggests , Russell 2000 ETFs closely track the Russell 2000 Index , which combines 2000 of the small - cap companies in the Russell universe of 3000 stocks . The Russell 3000 tracks nearly 98 % of all publicly traded U.S. stocks .
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . Both the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indexes are market - capitalization - weighted . Unlike the S&P 500 index , however , the securities in the Russell 2000 index are not selected by a committee , but rather through a formula based on their market cap and current index membership .
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . The most notable ETFs tracking the Russell 2000 index , in the order of their significance , are :
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . Here again , the higher liquidity of Blackrock 's IWM seems to drive its higher expense ratio . Compared to the S&P 500 ETFs , however , all funds tracking the Russell 2000 index command higher fees despite their much lower overall liquidity .
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . IWM is the heaviest traded Russell 2000 ETF , yet it trades at just one - quarter of the volume of SPDR 's SPY . The higher fees of Russell 2000 ETFs are likely due to the increased management effort of periodically balancing a larger number of securities .
--------------------------
Russell 2000 ETF . Russell 2000 ETFs may look more attractive than S&P 500 ETFs at the start of a bull market . The Russell 2000 constituents on average are bound to outperform their big brothers in the S&P 500 Index if the uptrend continues . The challenge is the volatility of their returns . So , as an investor , you may be in for a rough ride .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . The advantages of ETFs as an attractive investment for those who are content with matching the return on a wider market at a fraction of an active management cost . Investors have many ETFs to choose from based on the size , geographical location , or sector affiliation of companies in the index .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . Two of the more popular choices are the S&P 500 ETFs and Russell 2000 ETFs . Key distinctions between them are driven by the size of the companies in the index they track — large - cap for the S&P 500 and small - cap for the Russell 2000—the volatility of the underlying index , the method of constituent selection , and the fees they charge .
