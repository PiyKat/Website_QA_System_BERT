What is Risk Tolerance . Risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand in their financial planning . Risk tolerance is an important component in investing . You should have a realistic understanding of your ability and willingness to stomach large swings in the value of your investments ; if you take on too much risk , you might panic and sell at the wrong time .
--------------------------
Breaking down Risk Tolerance . Risk tolerance assessments for investors abound , including risk - related surveys or questionnaires . As an investor , you may also want to review historical worst - case returns for different asset classes to get an idea of how much money you would feel comfortable losing if your investments have a bad year or bad series of years . Other factors affecting risk tolerance are the time horizon you have to invest , your future earning capacity , and the presence of other assets such as a home , pension , Social Security , or an inheritance . In general , you can take greater risk with investable assets when you have other , more stable sources of funds available .
--------------------------
Aggressive Risk Tolerance . Aggressive investors tend to be market - savvy . A deep understanding of securities and their propensities allows such individuals and institutional investors to purchase highly volatile instruments , such as small - company stocks that can plummet to zero or options contracts that can expire worthlessly . While maintaining a base of riskless securities , aggressive investors reach for maximum returns with maximum risk .
--------------------------
Moderate Risk Tolerance . Moderate investors accept some risk to the principal but adopt a balanced approach with intermediate - term time horizons of five to 10 years . Combining large - company mutual funds with less volatile bonds and riskless securities , moderate investors often pursue a 50/50 structure . A typical strategy might involve investing half of the portfolio in a dividend - paying , growth fund .
--------------------------
Conservative Risk Tolerance . Conservative investors are willing to accept little to no volatility in their investment portfolios . Often , retirees who have spent decades building a nest egg are unwilling to allow any type of risk to their principal . A conservative investor targets vehicles that are guaranteed and highly liquid . Risk - averse individuals opt for bank certificates of deposit ( CDs ) , money markets , or U.S. Treasuries for income and preservation of capital .
