What Is a Treasury Bond ? . A Treasury bond ( T - bond ) is a government debt security that earns interest until maturity , at which point the owner is also paid a par amount equal to the principal . Treasury bonds are part of the larger category of government bonds , a type of bond issued by a national government with a commitment to pay period interest payments known as coupon payments as well as the principal upon maturity . Treasury bonds are marketable , fixed - interest U.S. government debt securities with a maturity of more than 10 years . As is true for other government bonds , Treasury bonds make interest payments semiannually , and the income received is only taxed at the federal level . T - bonds are known in the market as primarily risk - free ; they are issued by the U.S. government with very little risk of default . Silver stocks and other rare metals are often dependent on current treasury bond rates .
--------------------------
Understanding T - Bonds . Treasury bonds ( T - bonds ) are one of four types of debt issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to finance the government ’s spending activities . The four types of debt are Treasury bills , Treasury notes , Treasury bonds and Treasury Inflation - Protected Securities ( TIPS ) . The securities vary by maturity and coupon payments . All of them are considered benchmarks to their comparable fixed - income categories since they are virtually risk - free , backed by the U.S. government , which can raise taxes and increase revenue to ensure full payments . These investments are also considered benchmarks in their respective fixed - income categories because they offer a base risk - free rate of investment with the categories ' lowest return .

Special Considerations . Treasury bonds are issued with maturities that can range from 10 to 30 years . They are issued with a minimum denomination of $ 1,000 , and coupon payments on the bonds are paid semiannually . The bonds are initially sold through auction in which the maximum purchase amount is $ 5 million if the bid is noncompetitive or 35 % of the offering if the bid is competitive . A competitive bid states the rate the bidder is willing to accept ; it is accepted depending on how it compares with the set rate of the bond . A noncompetitive bid ensures the bidder gets the bond , but he has to accept the set rate . After the auction , the bonds can be sold in the secondary market .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . There is an active secondary market for Treasury bonds , making the investments highly liquid . The secondary market also makes the price of Treasury bonds fluctuate considerably on the trading market . As such , current auction and yield rates of Treasury bonds dictate their pricing levels on the secondary market . Similar to other types of bonds , Treasury bonds on the secondary market see prices go down when auction rates increase , as the value of the bond ’s future cash flows is discounted at the higher rate . Inversely , when prices increase , auction rate yields decrease .
--------------------------
Special Considerations . In the fixed - income market , Treasury bond yields help to form the yield curve , which includes the full range of investments offered by the U.S. government . The yield curve diagrams yields by maturity and is most often upward sloping , with lower maturities offering lower rates than longer - dated maturities . However , when longer maturities are in high demand , the yield curve can be inverted , which shows longer maturities with rates lower than shorter - term maturities .
