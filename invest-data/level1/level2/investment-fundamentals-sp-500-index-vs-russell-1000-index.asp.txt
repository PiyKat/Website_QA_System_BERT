S&P 500 vs. Russell 1000 : An Overview . While the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index ( S&P 500 ) and the Russell 1000 Index are both considered large - cap stock indices , with stocks of companies valued at more than $ 10 billion , there are some differences between the two , including how well they reflect the current market , composition , qualifications for stock inclusion in each index , and risks related to all of those factors .
--------------------------
S&P 500 . Outside of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) , the S&P 500 is the best - known barometer for large - cap stocks in the United States . The index has been around since 1923 but assumed its present format in 1957 . As the name suggests , it 's composed of 500 of the largest publicly - traded companies in the country . The index is used as the benchmark for dozens of mutual funds and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) .
--------------------------
S&P 500 . With one index holding 500 stocks and the other holding 1,000 , the composition of the two indices are clearly different . While the S&P 500 is composed primarily of large - cap stocks , defined by at least a $ 4 billion market cap , the Russell 1000 collects more mid - cap stocks to fill out its portfolio composition .
--------------------------
S&P 500 . The S&P 500 and Russell 1000 determine inclusion using relatively similar methodologies . To be included , both indices require that their components be defined as " U.S. companies . " They both look at factors such as where the company is headquartered , where it derives revenue , and where most of its assets are located . Stocks must also trade on either the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) or the Nasdaq .
--------------------------
Russell 1000 . The Russell 1000 is a relatively newer index , having started in 1984 . It is also less well - known than the S&P 500 , but it represents a similarly broad stock market performance . Administered by FTSE Russell , it is a subset of the broader Russell 3000 Index , which includes 3,000 stocks accounting for more than 98 % of total stock market capitalization . The largest 1,000 stocks go into the Russell 1000 Index , and the smaller 2,000 go into the more well - known Russell 2000 small - cap index .
--------------------------
Russell 1000 . Stock prices change every minute of every business day . Therefore , publicly - traded company values are constantly changing , and it is up to an index 's administrators to keep up with these changes to reflect the current times . The process of changing the weighting of assets in a portfolio is called rebalancing . However , the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 change on different schedules .
--------------------------
Russell 1000 . The S&P 500 rebalances its portfolio on a quarterly basis , while the Russell 1000 is only rebalanced once a year at the end of the second quarter . Although it may not seem like a big issue , update frequency can affect how well mutual funds and ETFs benchmarked to the index can perform relative to the market . The slower an index rebalances , the longer it takes for it to be representative of the current market .
--------------------------
Russell 1000 . The Russell 1000 's mid - cap composition is shown by the median market capitalization of its stocks . The S&P 500 had a $ 22.28 billion median market cap , compared to the Russell 1000 's $ 10.97 billion median market cap , as of April 30 , 2019 . This distinction is important because mid - cap stocks generally maintain a higher - risk , higher - return potential profile . Therefore , the Russell 1000 Index should be considered slightly more risky than the S&P 500 .
--------------------------
Russell 1000 . Closed - end funds , mutual funds , ETFs , and thinly traded stocks are ineligible for inclusion in either index . The only minor difference between the indices here is that Business Development Corporations ( BDCs ) are eligible for the S&P 500 , but not for the Russell 1000 .
