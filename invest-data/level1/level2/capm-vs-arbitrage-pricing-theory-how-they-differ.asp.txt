CAPM vs. Arbitrage Pricing Theory : An Overview . In the 1960s , Jack Treynor , William F. Sharpe , John Lintner , and Jan Mossin developed the capital asset pricing model ( CAPM ) to determine the theoretical appropriate rate that an asset should return given the level of risk assumed . Thereafter , in 1976 , economist Stephen Ross developed the arbitrage pricing theory ( APT ) as an alternative to the CAPM . The APT introduced a framework that explains the expected theoretical rate of return of an asset , or portfolio , in equilibrium as a linear function of the risk of the asset , or portfolio , with respect to a set of factors capturing systematic risk .
--------------------------
Capital Asset Pricing Model . The CAPM allows investors to quantify the expected return on an investment given the investment risk , risk - free rate of return , expected market return , and the beta of an asset or portfolio . The risk - free rate of return that is used is typically the federal funds rate or the 10-year government bond yield .
--------------------------
Capital Asset Pricing Model . An asset 's or portfolio 's beta measures the theoretical volatility in relation to the overall market . For example , if a portfolio has a beta of 1.25 in relation to the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index ( S&P 500 ) , it is theoretically 25 percent more volatile than the S&P 500 Index . Therefore , if the index rises by 10 percent , the portfolio rises by 12.5 percent . If the index falls by 10 percent , the portfolio falls by 12.5 percent .
--------------------------
Capital Asset Pricing Model . The formula used in CAPM is : E(ri ) = rf + βi * ( E(rM ) - rf ) , where rf is the risk - free rate of return , βi is the asset 's or portfolio 's beta in relation to a benchmark index , E(rM ) is the expected benchmark index 's returns over a specified period , and E(ri ) is the theoretical appropriate rate that an asset should return given the inputs .
--------------------------
Arbitrage Pricing Theory . The APT serves as an alternative to the CAPM , and it uses fewer assumptions and may be harder to implement than the CAPM . Ross developed the APT on the basis that the prices of securities are driven by multiple factors , which could be grouped into macroeconomic or company - specific factors . Unlike the CAPM , the APT does not indicate the identity or even the number of risk factors . Instead , for any multifactor model assumed to generate returns , which follows a return - generating process , the theory gives the associated expression for the asset ’s expected return . While the CAPM formula requires the input of the expected market return , the APT formula uses an asset 's expected rate of return and the risk premium of multiple macroeconomic factors .
--------------------------
Arbitrage Pricing Theory . In the APT model , an asset 's or a portfolio 's returns follow a factor intensity structure if the returns could be expressed using this formula : ri = ai + βi1 * F1 + βi2 * F2 + ... + βkn * Fn + εi , where ai is a constant for the asset ; F is a systematic factor , such as a macroeconomic or company - specific factor ; β is the sensitivity of the asset or portfolio in relation to the specified factor ; and εi is the asset 's idiosyncratic random shock with an expected mean of zero , also known as the error term .
--------------------------
Arbitrage Pricing Theory . The APT formula is E(ri ) = rf + βi1 * RP1 + βi2 * RP2 + ... + βkn * RPn , where rf is the risk - free rate of return , β is the sensitivity of the asset or portfolio in relation to the specified factor and RP is the risk premium of the specified factor .
--------------------------
Key Differences . At first glance , the CAPM and APT formulas look identical , but the CAPM has only one factor and one beta . Conversely , the APT formula has multiple factors that include non - company factors , which requires the asset 's beta in relation to each separate factor . However , the APT does not provide insight into what these factors could be , so users of the APT model must analytically determine relevant factors that might affect the asset 's returns . On the other hand , the factor used in the CAPM is the difference between the expected market rate of return and the risk - free rate of return .
--------------------------
. Since the CAPM is a one - factor model and simpler to use , investors may want to use it to determine the expected theoretical appropriate rate of return rather than using APT , which requires users to quantify multiple factors .
