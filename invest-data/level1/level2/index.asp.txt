What Is an Index ? . An index is an indicator or measure of something , and in finance , it typically refers to a statistical measure of change in a securities market . In the case of financial markets , stock , and bond market indices consist of a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of it . ( You can not invest directly in an index . ) The S&P 500 and the US Aggregate Bond Index are common benchmarks for the American stock and bond markets , respectively . In reference to mortgages , it refers to a benchmark interest rate created by a third party .
--------------------------
Indices Explained . Each index related to the stock and bond markets has its own calculation methodology . In most cases , the relative change of an index is more important than the actual numeric value representing the index . For example , if the Financial Times Stock Exchange ( FTSE ) 100 is at 6,670.40 , that number tells investors the index is nearly seven times its base level of 1,000 . However , to assess how the index has changed from the previous day , investors must look at the amount the index has fallen , often expressed as a percentage .

Relationship Between Trading Indices , Mutual Funds and Exchange - Traded Funds . When putting together mutual funds and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) , fund sponsors attempt to create portfolios mirroring the components of a certain index . This allows an investor to buy a security likely to rise and fall in tandem with the stock market as a whole or with a segment of the market .

Relationship Between Trading Indices , Mutual Funds and Exchange - Traded Funds . Indexes are also often used as benchmarks against which to measure the performance of mutual funds and ETFs . For instance , many mutual funds compare their returns to the return in the Standard & Poor 's 500 to give investors a sense of how much more or less the managers are earning on their money than they would make in an index fund .
--------------------------
Examples of Trading Indices . The Standard & Poor 's 500 is one of the world 's best - known indices and one of the most commonly used benchmarks for the stock market . It includes 75 % of the total stocks traded in the United States . Conversely , the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) is also a very well - known index , but it only represents stock values from 30 of the nation 's publicly traded companies . Other prominent indices include the Nasdaq ; the Wilshire 5000 ; the MSCI EAFE , which includes foreign stocks based in Europe , Australasia and the Far East ; and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index , now known as Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index .

Definition of Indexed Annuity . Like mutual funds , indexed annuities are tied to a trading index . However , rather than the fund sponsor trying to put together an investment portfolio likely to closely mimic the index in question , these securities feature a rate of return that follows a particular index but typically have caps on the returns they provide . For example , if an investor buys an annuity indexed to the Dow Jones and it has a cap of 10 % , its rate of return will be between 0 and 10 % , depending on the annual changes to that index . Indexed annuities allow investors to buy securities that grow along with broad market segments or the total market .
--------------------------
Mortgage Index . Adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) feature interest rates that adjust over the life of the loan . The adjustable interest rate is determined by adding a margin to an index . One of the most popular mortgage indices is the London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) . For example , if a mortgage indexed to the LIBOR has a 2 % margin and the LIBOR is 3 % , the interest rate on the loan is 5 % .
--------------------------
Index Funds . Because you can not invest directly in an index , index funds are created to track their performance . These funds incorporate securities that closely mimic those found in an index , thereby allowing an investor to bet on its performance , for a fee . An example of a popular index fund is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF , which closely mirrors the S&P 500 index .
