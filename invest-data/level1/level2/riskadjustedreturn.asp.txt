What Is a Risk - Adjusted Return ? . Risk - adjusted return defines an investment 's return by measuring how much risk is involved in producing that return , which is generally expressed as a number or rating . Risk - adjusted returns are applied to individual securities , investment funds , and portfolios .
--------------------------
What Is a Risk - Adjusted Return ? . Some common risk measures include alpha , beta , R - squared , standard deviation and the Sharpe ratio . When comparing two or more potential investments , an investor should always compare the same risk measures to each different investment to get a relative performance perspective .
--------------------------
Understanding Risk - Adjusted Return . In its simplest definition , risk - adjusted return is of how much return your investment has made relative to the amount of risk the investment has taken over a given period of time . If two or more investments have the same return over a given time period , the one that has the lowest risk will have the better risk - adjusted return . However , considering that different risk measurements give investors very different analytical results , it is important to be clear on what type of risk - adjusted return is being considered . Below are examples of conflicting risk - adjusted return calculations and their implications .
--------------------------
Sharpe Ratio Example . The Sharpe ratio is a measure of an investment 's excess return , above the risk - free rate , per unit of standard deviation . It is calculated by taking the return of the investment , subtracting the risk - free rate , and dividing this result by the investment 's standard deviation . All else equal , a higher Sharpe ratio is better . The standard deviation shows the volatility of an investment 's returns relative to its average return . Greater standard deviations reflect wider returns , and narrower standard deviations imply more concentrated returns . The risk - free rate is the yield on a no - risk investment , such as a Treasury bond .
--------------------------
Sharpe Ratio Example . Mutual Fund A returns 12 % over the past year and had a standard deviation of 10 % . Mutual Fund B returns 10 % and had a standard deviation of 7 % . The risk - free rate over the time period was 3 % . The Sharpe ratios would be calculated as follows :
--------------------------
Sharpe Ratio Example . Mutual Fund A : ( 12 % - 3 % ) / 10 % = 0.9
--------------------------
Sharpe Ratio Example . Mutual Fund B : ( 10 % - 3 % ) / 7 % = 1
--------------------------
Sharpe Ratio Example . Even though Mutual Fund A had a higher return , Mutual Fund B had a higher risk - adjusted return , meaning that it gained more per unit of total risk than Mutual Fund A.
--------------------------
Treynor Ratio Example . The Treynor ratio is calculated the same way as the Sharpe ratio , but it uses the investment 's beta in the denominator . A higher Treynor ratio is better . Using the previous fund example , and assuming that each of the funds has a beta of 0.75 , the calculations are as follows :
--------------------------
Treynor Ratio Example . Mutual Fund A : ( 12 % - 3 % ) / 0.75 = 0.12
--------------------------
Treynor Ratio Example . Mutual Fund B : ( 10 % - 3 % ) / 0.75 = 0.09
--------------------------
Treynor Ratio Example . Here , Mutual Fund A has a higher Treynor ratio , meaning that the fund is earning more return per unit of systematic risk than Fund B. Given this result and the result of the Sharpe ratio calculation , it can be concluded that Fund B is more efficiently earning returns per unit of unsystematic risk .
--------------------------
What Risk - Adjusted Returns Mean . Risk - adjusted returns can have a severe impact on portfolios . In strong markets , a fund with lower risk than the benchmark can limit returns , and a fund that entertains more risk than the benchmark may experience more sizable returns . It has been shown that , while losses may accrue in higher - risk funds during volatile periods , funds with a greater appetite for risk are more likely to outperform their benchmarks over full market cycles .
