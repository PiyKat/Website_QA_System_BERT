Futures Market Example . For instance , if a coffee farm sells green coffee beans at $ 4 per pound to a roaster , and the roaster sells that roasted pound at $ 10 per pound and both are making a profit at that price , they ’ll want to keep those costs at a fixed rate . The investor agrees that if the price for coffee goes below a set rate , the investor agrees to pay the difference to the coffee farmer .
--------------------------
Futures Market Example . If the price of coffee goes higher than a certain price , the investor gets to keep profits . For the roaster , if the price of green coffee goes above an agreed rate , the investor pays the difference and the roaster gets the coffee at a predictable rate . If the price of green coffee is lower than an agreed - upon rate , the roaster pays the same price and the investor gets the profit .
