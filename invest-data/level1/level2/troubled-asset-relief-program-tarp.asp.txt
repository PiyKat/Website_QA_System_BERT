What Was the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) ? . The Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) was an initiative created and run by the U.S. Treasury to stabilize the country ’s financial system , restore economic growth , and mitigate foreclosures in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis . TARP sought to achieve these targets by purchasing troubled companies ’ assets and stock .
--------------------------
How the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) Worked . Global credit markets came to a near standstill in September 2008 , as several major financial institutions , such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and American International Group ( AIG ) , experienced severe financial problems , and others , like Lehman Brothers , went bankrupt — the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis that had begun the previous year . Investment companies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley changed their charters to become commercial banks , in an attempt to stabilize their capital situations .
--------------------------
Key Takeaways . To prevent the situation from completely spiraling out of control , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pioneered the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) . It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3 , 2008 , with the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act .
--------------------------
Key Takeaways . TARP 's original purpose : to increase the liquidity of the money markets and secondary mortgage markets by purchasing the mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , and through that , reducing the potential losses of the institutions that owned them . Later , its aim was modified slightly to allow the government to buy equity in banks and other financial institutions . TARP initially gave the Treasury purchasing power of $ 700 billion ; the Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( simply referred to as Dodd - Frank ) later reduced the $ 700 billion authorization to $ 475 billion .
--------------------------
. TARP funds went to purchase stock in banks , insurance companies , and auto - makers , and to loan funds to financial institutions and to homeowners .
--------------------------
. The U.S. government bought preferred stock in eight banks : Bank of America / Merrill Lynch , Bank of New York Mellon , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan , Morgan Stanley , State Street , and Wells Fargo . The banks were required to give the government a 5 % dividend that would increase to 9 % in 2013 , encouraging banks to buy back the stock within five years . From the program ’s inception until October 3 , 2010 ( the deadline for extending funds ) , $ 245 billion went to stabilize banks , $ 27 billion went to programs to increase credit availability , $ 80 billion went to the U.S. auto industry ( specifically , to GM and Chrysler ) , $ 68 billion went to stabilize AIG , and $ 46 billion went to foreclosure - prevention programs , such as Making Home Affordable .
--------------------------
. The provisions of TARP demanded that companies involved lose certain tax benefits and , in many cases , placed limits on executive compensation and forbade fund recipients from awarding bonuses to their top 25 highest - paid executives . Even so , by 2009 , bailed - out firms paid some $ 20 billion to key personnel — sardonically referred to as TARP bonuses .
--------------------------
The Legacy of TARP . In December 2013 , the Treasury wrapped up TARP and the government concluded that its investments had earned more than $ 11 billion for taxpayers . To be more specific , TARP recovered funds totaling $ 441.7 billion from $ 426.4 billion invested . The government also claimed that TARP prevented the American auto industry from failing and saved more than 1 million jobs , helped stabilize banks , and restored credit availability for individuals and businesses .
--------------------------
The Legacy of TARP . Even so , economists , politicians and financial professionals still debate TARP 's merits and wonder if it had been necessary . Critics charge the program did little to help the housing markets , which remained depressed for years . Some say it did n't go far enough — that the government should have insisted on an equity stake in the financial firms it was bailing out , to help control their future practices . Instead , they say , TARP 's no - strings loans essentially acted as a reward for bad behavior , sending a message of " Act irresponsibly and we 'll help you out"—and establishing a dangerous precedent of dependency .
--------------------------
The Legacy of TARP . TARP also did not endear the government to the American public , which saw Wall Street reap benefits — including those notorious bonuses — and return to profitability , even as individuals struggled with debt , unemployment , and foreclosures in the wake of the Great Recession .
