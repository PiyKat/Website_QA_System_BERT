What Is a Second Mortgage ? . A second mortgage is a type of subordinate mortgage made while an original mortgage is still in effect . In the event of default , the original mortgage would receive all proceeds from the liquidation of the property until it is all paid off .
--------------------------
What Is a Second Mortgage ? . Since the second mortgage would receive repayments only when the first mortgage has been paid off , the interest rate charged for the second mortgage tends to be higher and the amount borrowed will be lower than that of the first mortgage .
--------------------------
What Is a Second Mortgage ? . A second mortgage is also called a home equity loan .
--------------------------
How a Second Mortgage Works . When most people purchase a home or property , they take out a home loan from a lending institution that uses the property as collateral . This home loan is called a mortgage , or more specifically , a first mortgage .
--------------------------
How a Second Mortgage Works . The borrower is required to repay the loan in monthly installments made up of a portion of the principal amount and interest payments . Over time , as the homeowner makes good on his monthly payments , the value of the home also appreciates economically .
--------------------------
How a Second Mortgage Works . The difference between the current market value of the home and any remaining mortgage payments is called home equity .
--------------------------
How a Second Mortgage Works . A homeowner may decide to borrow against his home equity to fund other projects or expenditures . The loan he takes out against his home equity is known as a second mortgage , as he already has an outstanding first mortgage . The second mortgage is a lump sum of payment made out to the borrower at the beginning of the loan .
--------------------------
How a Second Mortgage Works . Like first mortgages , second mortgages must be repaid over a specified term at a fixed or variable interest rate , depending on the loan agreement signed with the lender . The loan must be paid off first before the borrower can take on another mortgage against his home equity .
--------------------------
. Second mortgages are often riskier because the primary mortgage has priority and is paid first in the event of default .
--------------------------
. Some borrowers use a home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) as a second mortgage . A HELOC is a revolving line of credit that is guaranteed by the equity in the home . The HELOC account is structured like a credit card account in that you can only borrow up to a pre - determined amount and make monthly payments on the account depending on how much you currently owe on the loan .
--------------------------
. As the balance of the loan increases , so will the payments . However , the interest rates on a HELOC and second mortgages , in general , are lower than interest rates on credit cards and unsecured debt .
--------------------------
. Since the first or purchase mortgage is used as a loan for buying the property , many people use second mortgages as loans for large expenditures that may be very difficult to finance . For example , people may take on a second mortgage to fund a child 's college education or to purchase a new vehicle .
--------------------------
. Second mortgages also can be a method to consolidate debt by using the money from the second mortgage to pay off other sources of outstanding debt , which may have carried even higher interest rates .
--------------------------
. Because the second mortgage also uses the same property for collateral as the first mortgage , the original mortgage has priority on the collateral should the borrower default on his payments . If the loan goes into default , the first mortgage lender gets paid first before the second mortgage lender . This means that second mortgages are riskier for lenders who ask for a higher interest rate on these mortgages than on the original mortgage .
--------------------------
. Like the purchase mortgage , there are costs associated with taking out a second mortgage . These costs include appraisal fees , costs to run a credit check , and origination fees .
--------------------------
. Although most second mortgage lenders state that they do n’t charge closing costs , the borrower still must pay closing costs in some way as the cost is included in the total cost of taking out a second loan on a home .
--------------------------
. Since a lender in a second position takes on more risk than one in the first position , not all lenders offer a second mortgage . Those that do take great steps to ensure that the borrower is good to make payments on the loan . When considering a borrower ’s application for a home equity loan , the lender will check whether the property has significant equity in the first mortgage , high credit score , stable employment history , and low debt - to - income ratio .
