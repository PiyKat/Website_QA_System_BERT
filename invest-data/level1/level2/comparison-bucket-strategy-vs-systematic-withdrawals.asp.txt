Bucket Strategy vs. Systematic Withdrawals . There are many different strategies that can be used to generate retirement income . But the big two are the systematic withdrawal approach and the bucket approach . According to a 2011 study , 75 % of financial advisors frequently or always use a systematic withdrawal strategy and 38 % frequently or always use a time - based segmentation approach , aka bucket strategy . ( The numbers add up to more than 100 % because some advisors use both approaches . )
--------------------------
Bucketing . Bucket or segmentation strategies divide assets into different “ buckets , ” depending on the time remaining until withdrawal and the client ’s risk appetite . For example , the first bucket may contain cash and cash equivalents needed over the next five years , while the last bucket may contain riskier equities that wo n’t have to be sold for a decade or more . These buckets can be rebalanced at any time to reflect changes in income requirements or risk tolerance . ( For more , see : Will a Systematic Withdrawal Plan Work for You ? )
--------------------------
Systematic Withdrawal . By contrast , the basic tenet of the systematic withdrawal approach is that you invest across a broad spectrum of asset classes and withdraw a proportionate amount each month . In other words , it treats all of a client ’s assets alike , subtracting the required income from the total . The fully diversified portfolio is regularly rebalanced to account for these regular withdrawals over time . There ’s only a single asset allocation target to maintain and there are predictable 4 % to 5 % annual withdrawals . ( For more , see : Why the 4 % Retirement Rule Is No Longer Safe . )
--------------------------
Psychological Differences . Financial advisors prefer to use the systematic withdrawal strategy since it ’s an easier strategy to maintain and more predictable over the long run . Unfortunately , some clients have a hard time with these types of strategies when the market experiences a sharp downturn or correction . They may see the aggregate value of their retirement account trend lower and become worried , which could lead to risk - aversion and poor decision - making .
--------------------------
Psychological Differences . Bucket strategies are an excellent way to alleviate these concerns . Since short - term investments are held in cash or other liquid securities , the same market downturn may only affect long - term “ buckets ” that clients may be less concerned about , given the long time horizon until they need the distributions . These psychological benefits can save significant sums of money by preventing panic - fueled decisions .
--------------------------
Psychological Differences . These tendencies stem from so - called mental accounting local fallacies and cognitive biases that are common in finance . For example , people tend to spend more on a credit card than they would with cash ; the expenditure does n't feel as real , somehow . Similarly , clients may have the exact same amount of money in the same investments , but segregating the account into different labels can encourage them to take on different levels of risk .
--------------------------
Allocation Similarities . The bucket and systematic withdrawal strategies may seem like very different approaches on the surface , but they may be extremely similar when looking at portfolio allocations and performance ( independent of client actions ) . According to a Principal Financial Group , Inc. ( PFG ) analysis , clients may feel more secure with a bucket strategy , but it may not provide financial benefits beyond the systematic withdrawal strategy , which is less complicated to manage .
--------------------------
Allocation Similarities . A bucket strategy often produces substantially similar asset allocations as the systematic withdrawal strategy , although different bucket portfolio allocation strategies can be used in different cases . For instance , a client may have 60 % of their assets in cash and short - term bonds in the first couple of buckets , and 40 % of their assets in riskier equities and high - yield bonds in their second few buckets . All this is very similar to a 60/40 income / growth systematic allocation .
--------------------------
Allocation Similarities . In either case , the key for financial advisors is ensuring that the asset allocation is ideally suited for the individual client . Those willing to take on more risk will be more heavily weighted in equities , while those less willing to assume risk may be more heavily weighted in bonds , annuities , or cash equivalents . Obviously , the client ’s time horizon also plays an important role in establishing these same parameters .
--------------------------
Implementation Challenges . The bucket strategy has been very successful in terms of the psychological benefits to clients , but there are some challenges with implementation . In general , there is a lack of standardized tools to calculate allocations across buckets . There are a few frameworks that are used throughout the industry to help guide their creation , but there are no gold standards that everyone has come to expect to make things simpler .
--------------------------
Implementation Challenges . Portfolio reporting software may also have trouble with a bucket strategy since these programs typically report on investments in aggregate or by account . While setting up separate accounts for each bucket may work in some cases , the costs of doing so may be too high and some mixtures of retirement and taxable accounts could create headaches for advisors . Rebalancing can also pose a challenge without the right tools in place to ensure proper allocations .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . The bucket strategy and systematic withdrawal strategy are similar in theory since asset allocations tend to be very similar between both options . That said , there ’s a very real difference between the two strategies in practice , thanks to the effects of local fallacies and investors ' cognitive biases . A bucket strategy often makes clients more comfortable with market declines and appropriate risk - taking than traditional systematic strategies do .
--------------------------
The Bottom Line . For financial advisors , the key decision to make is whether the added costs and complexities associated with the bucket strategy are worth the psychological benefits to clients . This can depend on a number of factors , such as the client ’s historical risk aversion and the advisor ’s own comfort with maintaining these types of portfolios . In the end , both strategies have their own benefits and drawbacks that must be considered before implementation .
