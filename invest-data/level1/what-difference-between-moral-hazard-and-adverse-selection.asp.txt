Moral Hazard vs. Adverse Selection : An Overview . Moral hazard and adverse selection are two terms used in economics , risk management , and insurance to describe situations where one party is at a disadvantage .
--------------------------
Moral Hazard vs. Adverse Selection : An Overview . Moral hazard occurs when there is asymmetric information between two parties and a change in the behavior of one party after a deal is struck . Adverse selection occurs when there 's a lack of symmetric information prior to a deal between a buyer and a seller .
--------------------------
Moral Hazard vs. Adverse Selection : An Overview . Asymmetric information , also called information failure , happens when one party to a transaction has greater material knowledge than the other party . Typically , the more knowledgeable party is the seller . Symmetric information is when both parties have equal knowledge .
--------------------------
Moral Hazard . Moral hazard occurs when a party that has agreed to a transaction provides misleading information or changes their behavior because they believe that they wo n't have to face any consequences for their actions .
--------------------------
. Moral hazard is the risk that one party has not entered into the contract in good faith or has provided false details about its assets , liabilities , or credit capacity .
--------------------------
. In addition , moral hazard may also mean a party has an incentive to take unusual risks in a desperate attempt to earn a profit before the contract settles .
--------------------------
Adverse Selection . Adverse selection describes a situation in which one party in a deal has more accurate and different information than the other party . The party with less information is at a disadvantage to the party with more information . This asymmetry causes a lack of efficiency in the price and quantity of goods and services . Most information in a market economy is transferred through prices , which means that adverse selection tends to result from ineffective price signals .
--------------------------
Example of Moral Hazard . For an example of moral hazard , consider the implications of buying insurance . Let 's assume a homeowner does not have homeowners insurance or flood insurance and lives in a flood zone . The homeowner is very careful and subscribes to a home security system that helps prevent burglaries . When there are storms , he prepares for floods by clearing the drains and moving furniture to prevent damage .
--------------------------
Example of Moral Hazard . However , the homeowner is tired of always having to worry about potential burglaries and preparing for floods , so he buys the home and flood insurance . After his house is insured , his behavior changes and he is less attentive , he leaves his doors unlocked , cancels the home security system subscription and does not prepare for floods . In this case , the insurance company is faced with the risks of floods and burglaries and their consequences , and the problem of moral hazard arises .
--------------------------
Example of Adverse Selection . Life insurance premiums can be a way of looking at an example of adverse selection . Let 's assume there are two sets of people in the population , those who smoke and do not exercise , and those who do not smoke and do exercise . It is common knowledge that those who smoke and do n't exercise have shorter life expectancies than those who do n't smoke and do exercise . Suppose there are two individuals who are looking to buy life insurance , one who smokes and does not exercise , and one who does n't smoke and exercises daily . However , the insurance company , without further information , can not differentiate between the individual who smokes and does n't exercise and the other person .
--------------------------
Example of Adverse Selection . The insurance company asks the individuals to fill out questionnaires to distinguish them . However , the individual that smokes and does n't exercise knows that answering truthfully means higher insurance premiums , so he lies and says he does n't smoke and exercises daily . This leads to adverse selection , where the life insurance company is at a disadvantage and then charges the same premium to both individuals . However , insurance is more valuable to the non - exercising smoker than the exercising non - smoker because one party has more to gain . The non - exercising smoker needs health insurance more and benefits from the lower premium .
