Sector Rotation . Sector rotation is the action of shifting investment assets from one sector of the economy to another. Sector rotation involves using the proceeds from the sale of securities related to a particular investment sector for the purchase of securities in another sector. This strategy is used as a method for capturing returns from market cycles and diversifying holdings over a specified holding period.
