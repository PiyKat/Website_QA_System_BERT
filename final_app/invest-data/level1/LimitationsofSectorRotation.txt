 Limitations of Sector Rotation . Sector rotation strategies can be expensive to implement because of the potential costs associated with extensive market trading, which can negatively affect returns. Moving capital in and out of sectors can be costly due to trading fees and commissions. For that reason, sector rotation is typically a strategy considered for institutional managers or high net worth investors. Sector rotation also requires very active analysis of investments and economic data. It is typically a consideration for professional portfolio managers because of the time constraints and data access involved.
