 Sharing . Sharing risk is often implemented through employer-based benefits that allow the company to pay a portion of insurance premiums with the employee.Â In essence, this shares the risk with the company and all employees participating in the insurance benefits. The understanding is that with more participants sharing the risks, the costs of premiums should shrink proportionately. Individuals may find it in their best interest to participate in sharing the risk by choosing employer health care and life insurance plans when possible.
