 Understanding Beta Risk . Beta risk may be defined as the risk found in incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis when an alternative hypothesis is true. Put simply, it is taking the position that there is no difference when, in fact, there is one. A statistical test should be employed to detect differences and the beta risk is the probability that a statistical test will be unable to do so. For example, if a beta risk is 0.05, there is a 5% likelihood of inaccuracy.
