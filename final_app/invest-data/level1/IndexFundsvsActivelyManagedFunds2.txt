 Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Passive management leading to positive performance tends to be true over the long term. With shorter timespans, active mutual funds do better. The SPIVA Scorecard indicates that in a span of one year, only 64% of large-cap mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500. In other words, over one-third of them beat it in the short term. Also, in other categories, actively managed money rules. As an example, nearly 85% of mid-cap mutual funds beat their S&P MidCap 400 Growth Index benchmark, in the course of a year. Even over the long term, when an actively managed fund is good, it is very, very good. Investor's Business Daily's "Best Mutual Funds 2019" report lists dozens of funds that have racked up a 10-year average total return of 15% to 19%, compared to the S&P 500's 13.12%. They've significantly outperformed the market in one-, three-, and five-year periods, too. Admittedly, this a feat that only 13% of the 8,000 mutual funds out there can claim, as detailed in the report.
