 Sector Rotation Investment Funds . Sector rotation investment funds are not broadly offered for retail investors in the investment universe. Fidelity manages one fund, the Sector Rotation Fund, which is now closed to new investors. The Fund was launched in December 2009 and reports an annual return of 9.04% since inception. The Fund invests across multiple asset classes. It uses a fund of funds strategy with ETFs invested across market sectors. Weightings of market sectors are adjusted based on sector rotation views. Several institutional investment managers also offer sector rotation investing strategies. These managers typically use a fund of funds strategy to obtain market exposure. Institutional investment managers offer sector rotation funds based on the sectors of a single economy, or they may also use sector rotation to develop a portfolio of investments across individual countries.
