 Examples of Financial Advisors . What may pass as a financial advisor in some instances may be a product salesperson, such as a stockbroker or a life insurance agent. A true financial advisor should be a well-educated, credentialed, experienced, financial professional who works on behalf of his clients as opposed to serving the interests of a financial institution. Generally, a financial advisor is an independent practitioner who operates in a fiduciary capacity in which a clientâ€™s interests come before their own. Only Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), who are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, are held to a true fiduciary standard. There are some agents and brokers who try to practice in this capacity. However, their compensation structure is such that they are bound by the contracts of the companies where they work.
