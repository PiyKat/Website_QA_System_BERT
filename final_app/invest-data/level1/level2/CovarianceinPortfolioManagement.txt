 Covariance in Portfolio Management . Covariance applied to a portfolio can help determine what assets to include in the portfolio. It measures whether stocks move in the same direction (a positive covariance) or in opposite directions (a negative covariance). When constructing a portfolio, a portfolio manager will select stocks that work well together, which usually means these stocks would not move in the same direction.
