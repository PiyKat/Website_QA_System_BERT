 Moral Hazard . Moral hazard describes the behavioral changes that might increase the risk of loss taken because the actor will not bear responsibility should things go wrong. Insurance industry people use to term to refer to the possibility that after receiving coverage, a person might act in a risky way for personal gain because the insurance company will have to cover all losses. Moral hazard is the idea that insurance promotes risk-taking for personal gain. One type of moral hazard is ex-ante. Ex-ante hazard defines the behavioral change of a policyholder before an event occurs. For example, suppose Milton, a professional cliff diver, does not have health insurance. He goes through his career without doing the dangerous dives that could send him to the hospital. Milton knows should he get hurt and need to go to the hospital, he will have to pay the medical bills out-of-pocket. Milton decides to get health insurance, and once his insurance policy goes into effect, he begins to do the dangerous dives. Milton, consciously, takes on riskier behavior than he had before he got insurance because he has reduced his liability. Ex-post moral hazard refers to the behavior of a party after an event occurs. For example, suppose a person takes out a loan from a bank to start a business. After he receives the credit, he may say his business failed—although it was profitable—to get a bailout or tax write-off. This purposeful behavior is known as an ex-post moral hazard. Moral hazard describes a conscious change in behavior to try to benefit from an event that occurs. Conversely, morale hazard describes an unconscious change in a person's behavior when he is insured.
