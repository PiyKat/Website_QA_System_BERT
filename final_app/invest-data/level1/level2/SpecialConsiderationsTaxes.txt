 Special Considerations—Taxes . Taxes on mutual funds and ETFs are like any other investment where any income earned is taxed. Investors must pay either the short-term or long-term capital gains tax when selling their shares for a profit. Short-term capital gains apply to shares held less than one year before selling. Long-term taxes include the profit from shares sold after holding for a year or longer. For 2019, short-term capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on the investor's ordinary income tax bracket. Investors in mutual funds and ETFs must also pay taxes on any dividends they receive from the holding. Ordinary dividends are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Qualified dividends are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. Mutual funds typically have higher tax implications because they pay investors capital gains distributions. These capital distributions paid out by the mutual fund are taxable. ETFs usually do not payout capital distributions, and therefore, can have a slight tax advantage. For investors who hold their assets in a tax-advantaged vehicle like a 401(k), this advantage disappears. 401(k)s and other qualified plans take contributions on a tax-deferred basis. Money that is deposited—up to certain yearly limits—is not subject to any income tax. Further, the investments in the account can grow tax-free and do not incur taxes when trades are made.
