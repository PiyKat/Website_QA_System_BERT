 Using Options for Tax Management . Investors sometimes use options to change portfolio allocations without actually buying or selling the underlying security. For example, an investor may own 100 shares of XYZÂ stock and may be liable for a large unrealized capital gain. Not wanting to trigger a taxable event, shareholders may use options to reduce the exposure to the underlying security without actually selling it. While gains from call and put options are also taxable, their treatment by the IRS is more complex because of the multiple types and varieties of options. In the case above, the only cost to the shareholder for engaging in this strategy is the cost of the options contract itself.
