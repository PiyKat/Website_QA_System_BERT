 Should I Let My CD Roll Over? . As a general rule, letting your CD roll over into a similar CD term at the same institution is almost always unwise. If you still don’t need the cash, and are interested in starting a new CD, rolling it over is certainly the path of least resistance. But it also virtually never the path of maximum return. As we’ve mentioned, shopping around is imperative if you want to earn the top rate on your CD investments. And the odds are low that the bank where your CD is maturing is currently a top-rate provider among the hundreds of banks and credit unions from which you can choose a CD. It’s not impossible you’ll do well with a rolled-over CD, but the probabilities are against you, and shopping around is always your better bet. Even if you find your existing bank is indeed a top contender, you’ll be able to move into that CD purposefully and with confidence that you’ve done your homework to score a the best possible return.
