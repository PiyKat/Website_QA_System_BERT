 What Is a Treasury Bill? . A Treasury Bill (T-Bill) is a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less. Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $1,000. However, some can reach a maximum denomination of $5 million in non-competitive bids. These securities are widely regarded as low-risk and secure investments. The Treasury Department sells T-Bills during auctions using a competitive and non-competitive bidding process. Noncompetitive bids—also known as non-competitive tenders—have a price based on the average of all the competitive bids received. T-Bills tend to have a high tangible net worth.
