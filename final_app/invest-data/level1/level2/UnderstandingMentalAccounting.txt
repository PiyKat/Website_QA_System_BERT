 Understanding Mental Accounting . Richard Thaler, currently a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, introduced mental accounting in his 1999 paper "Mental Accounting Matters," which appeared in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making. He begins with this definition: "Mental accounting is the set of cognitive operations used by individuals and households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities." The paper is rich with examples of how mental accounting leads to irrational spending and investment behavior. Underlying the theory is the concept of fungibility of money. To say money is fungible means that, regardless of its origins or intended use, all money is the same. To avoid the mental accounting bias, individuals should treat money as perfectly fungible when they allocate among different accounts, be it a budget account (everyday living expenses), a discretionary spending account, or a wealth account (savings and investments). They also should value a dollar the same whether it is earned through work or given to them. However, Thaler observed that people frequently violate the fungibility principle, especially in a windfall situation. Take a tax refund. Getting a check from the IRS is generally regarded as "found money," something extra that the recipient often feels free to spend on a discretionary item. But in fact, the money rightfully belonged to the individual in the first place, as the word "refund" implies, and is mainly a restoration of money (in this case, an over-payment of tax), not a gift. Therefore, it should not be treated as a gift, but rather viewed in much the same way that the individual would view their regular income.
