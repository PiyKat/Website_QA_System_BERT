 The Action of Acquisition . Unfriendly deals, where target companies do not wish to be purchased, are always regarded as acquisitions. Therefore, a purchasing deal is classified as a merger or an acquisition, based on whether the purchase is friendly or hostile and how it is announced. In other words, the difference lies in how the deal is communicated to the target company's board of directors, employees and shareholders. Nestle, for instance, has performed a variety of acquisitions lately.
