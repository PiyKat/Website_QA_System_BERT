 Why Companies Pay Dividends . Companies pay dividends for a variety of reasons. These reasons can have different implications and interpretations for investors. Dividends are expected by the shareholders as a reward for their trust in a company and the company management aims to honor this sentiment by delivering a robust track record of dividend payments. Dividend payments reflect positively on a company and help maintain investors’ trust. Dividends are also preferred by shareholders as they are treated as tax-free income for shareholders in many jurisdictions, while capital gains realized through the sale of a share whose price has increased is taxable. Traders who look for short-term gains may also prefer getting dividend payments that offer instant tax-free gains. A high-value dividend declaration can indicate that the company is doing well and has generated good profits. But it can also indicate that the company does not have suitable projects to generate better returns. Therefore, it is utilizing its cash to pay shareholders instead of reinvesting it into growth. If a company has a long history of past dividend payments, reducing or eliminating the dividend amount may signal to investors that the company could be in trouble. The announcement of a 50% decrease in dividends from General Electric Co. (GE), one of the biggest American industrial companies, was accompanied by a decline of more than seven percent in GE’s stock price on November 13, 2017. A reduction in dividend amount or a decision against making any dividend payment may not necessarily translate into bad news about a company. It may be possible that the company's management has better plans for investing the money, given its financials and operations. For example, a company's management may choose to invest in a high return project that has the potential to magnify returns for shareholders in the long run as compared to the petty gains they will realize through dividend payments.
