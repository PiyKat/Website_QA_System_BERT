 Duration Strategies . In the financial press, you may have heard investors and analysts discuss long-duration or short-duration strategies, which can be confusing. In a trading and investing context, the word "long" would be used to describe a position where the investor owns the underlying asset or an interest in the asset that will appreciate in value if the price rises. The term "short" is used to describe a position where an investor has borrowed an asset or has an interest in the asset (e.g. derivatives) that will rise in value when the price falls in value. However, a long-duration strategy describes an investing approach where a bond investor focuses on bonds with a high duration value. In this situation, an investor is likely buying bonds with a long time before maturity and greater exposure to interest rate risks. A long-duration strategy works well when interest rates are falling, which usually happens during recessions. A short-duration strategy is one where a fixed-income or bond investor is focused on buying bonds with a small duration. This usually means the investor is focused on bonds with a small amount of time to maturity. A strategy like this would be employed when investors think interest rates will rise or when they are very uncertain about interest rates and want to reduce their risk.
