 The Essence of Merger . The terms "mergers" and "acquisitions" are often used interchangeably, although in actuality, they hold slightly different meanings. When one company takes over another entity, and establishes itself as the new owner, the purchase is called an acquisition. From a legal point of view, the target company ceases to exist, the buyer absorbs the business, and the buyer's stock continues to be traded, while the target companyâ€™s stock ceases to trade. On the other hand, a merger describes two firms of approximately the same size, who join forces to move forward as a single new entity, rather than remain separately owned and operated. This action is known as a "merger of equals." Both companies' stocks are surrendered and new company stock is issued in its place. Case in point: both Daimler-Benz and Chrysler ceased to exist when the two firms merged, and a new company, Daimler Chrysler, was created. A purchase deal will also be called a merger when both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies.
