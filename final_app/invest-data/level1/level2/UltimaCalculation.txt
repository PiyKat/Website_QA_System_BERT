 Ultima Calculation . The formula for ultima is shown in the image below. The calculation is looking at the rate of change of vomma over the rate of change in volatility. Assume that a call option has a vomma of three. This means vega will increase by three for each 1% change in implied volatility.  This is not static a static figure, though. As volatility rises or falls, the vega figure will also rise or fall. This is vomma. If vega is three but then increases to four on the next percentage rise in volatility, vomma is one.  Recall that vomma can be positive or negative. A positive figure will increase/decrease vega if volatility rises/falls. A negative figure will decrease/increase vega if volatility rises/falls. As ultima relates to vomma, traders who own options look for high or increasing vomma, while those who are short will look for negative and decreasing vomma. Ultima can help determine if vomma is increasing or decreasing as volatility changes.
