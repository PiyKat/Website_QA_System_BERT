 What Is Sensitivity Analysis? . A sensitivity analysis determines how different values of an independent variable affect a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions. In other words, sensitivity analyses study how various sources of uncertainty in a mathematical model contribute to the model's overall uncertainty. This technique is used within specific boundaries that depend on one or more input variables. Sensitivity analysis is used in the business world and in the field of economics. It is commonly used by financial analysts and economists, and is also known as a what-if analysis.
