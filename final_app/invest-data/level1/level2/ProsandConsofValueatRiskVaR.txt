 Pros and Cons of Value at Risk (VaR) . There are a few pros and some significant cons to using VaR in risk measurement. On the plus side, the measurement is widely used by financial industry professionals and, as a measure, it is easy to understand. The VaR offers clarity. For example, a VaR assessment might lead to the following statement: "We are 99% confident our losses will not exceed $5 million in a trading day." Regarding the drawbacks to VaR, the most critical is that the 99% confidence in the above example is the minimum dollar figure. For the 1% of occasions where our minimum loss does exceed that figure, there is no indication of how much. The loss could be $100 million or many orders of magnitude greater than the VaR threshold. Surprisingly, the model is designed to work this way because the probabilities in VaR are based on a normal distribution of returns. But financial markets are known to have non-normal distributions. Financial markets have extreme outlier events on a regular basis—far more than a normal distribution would predict. Finally, the VaR calculation requires several statistical measurements such as variance, covariance, and standard deviation. With a two-asset portfolio, this is relatively straightforward. However, the complexity increases exponentially for a highly diversified portfolio.
