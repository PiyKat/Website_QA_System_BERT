 Sound Management . In real estate, it’s all about “location, location, location." For penny stocks, it’s about “management, management, management." Sound management can turn around a struggling firm and launch a startup to new heights. More importantly, experienced and ethical management that have a vested interest in the company via share ownership can provide investors with a sense of security. Of course, superstar managers aren't often found working for penny stock companies, but there are a few examples. Take Concur Technologies, which bounced back from its post-tech bubble price of $0.31 and got bought out in 2014 at $129 per share. This remarkable comeback is owed to many factors, but one that stood out was the strong vested interest of President and CEO Rajeev Singh. Singh, who had co-founded the company in 1993, filled a plethora of management roles over the firm’s lifespan before he finally stepped down after Concur’s acquisition by software giant SAP SE (SAP).
