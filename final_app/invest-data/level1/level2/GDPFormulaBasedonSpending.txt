 GDP Formula Based on Spending . The expenditure approach, also known as spending approach, calculates the spending by the different groups that participate in the economy. This approach can be calculated using the following formula: GDP = C + G + I + NX, or (consumption + government spending + investment + net exports). All these activities contribute to the GDP of a country. The U.S. GDP is primarily measured based on the expenditure approach. The C is private consumption expenditures or consumer spending. Consumers spend money to buy consumption goods and services, such as groceries and haircuts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP, accounting for more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP. Consumer confidence, therefore, has a very significant bearing on economic growth. A high confidence level indicates that consumers are willing to spend, while a low confidence level reflects uncertainty about the future and an unwillingness to spend. The G represents government consumption expenditure and gross investment. Governments spend money on equipment, infrastructure, and payroll. Government spending assumes particular importance as a component of GDP when consumer spending and business investment both decline sharply, as, for instance, after a recession. The I is for private domestic investment or capital expenditures. Businesses spend money to invest in their business activities (buying machinery, for instance). Business investment is a critical component of GDP since it increases productive capacity and boosts employment. NX is net exports, calculated as total exports minus total imports (NX = Exports - Imports). Goods and services that an economy makes that are exported to other countries, less the imports that are brought in, are net exports. A current account surplus boosts a nationâ€™s GDP, while a chronic deficit is a drag on GDP. All expenditures by companies located in the country, even if they are foreign companies, are included in the calculation.
