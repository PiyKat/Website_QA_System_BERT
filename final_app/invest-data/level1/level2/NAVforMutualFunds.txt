 NAV for Mutual Funds . Unlike a stock whose price changes with every passing second, mutual funds don’t trade in real-time. Instead, mutual funds are priced based on the end of the day methodology based on their assets and liabilities. The assets of a mutual fund include the total market value of the fund's investments, cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accrued income. The market value of the fund is computed once per day based on the closing prices of the securities held in the fund's portfolio. Since a fund may have a certain amount of capital in the form of cash and liquid assets, that portion is accounted for under the cash and cash equivalents heading. Receivables include items such as dividend or interest payments applicable on that day, while accrued income refers to money that is earned by a fund but yet to be received. Sum of all these items and any of their qualifying variants constitute the fund’s assets. The liabilities of a mutual fund typically include money owed to the lending banks, pending payments and a variety of charges and fees owed to various associated entities. Additionally, a fund may have foreign liabilities that may be the shares issued to non-residents, income or dividend for which payments are pending to non-residents, and sale proceeds pending repatriation. All such outflows may be classified as long-term and short-term liabilities, depending upon the payment horizon. The liabilities of a fund also include accrued expenses, like staff salaries, utilities, operating expenses, management expenses, distribution and marketing expenses, transfer agent fees, custodian and audit fees, and other operational expenses. To compute the NAV for a particular day, all these various items falling under assets and liabilities are taken as of the end of a particular business day.
