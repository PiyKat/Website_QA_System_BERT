 What Is Equity? . Equity is typically referred to as shareholder equity (also known as shareholders' equity) which represents the amount of money that would be returned to a company’s shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debt was paid off.

Shareholder equity can also represent the book value of a company. Equity can sometimes be offered as payment-in-kind.
