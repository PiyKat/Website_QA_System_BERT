 Interest Rate Drivers . The interest rate charged by banks is determined by a number of factors such as the state of the economy. A countryâ€™s central bank sets the interest rate. When the central bank sets interest rates at a high level the cost of debt rises. When the cost of debt is high, thus discouraging people from borrowing and slows consumer demand. Also, interest rates tend to rise with inflation.
