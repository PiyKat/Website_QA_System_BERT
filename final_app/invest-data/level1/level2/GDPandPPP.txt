 GDP and PPP . There are a number of adjustments to GDP used by economists to improve its usefulness. On it's own, simple GDP shows us the size of the economy, but tells us little about the standard of living by itself. After all, populations and costs of living are not consistent around the world. Nothing much could be gleaned by comparing the nominal GDP of China to the nominal GDP of Ireland, for example. For starters, China has approximately 300 times the population of Ireland. To solve this problem, statisticians instead compare GDP per capita. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a country's total GDP by its population, and this figure is frequently cited to assess the nation's standard of living. Even so, the measure is still imperfect. Suppose China has a GDP per capita of $1,500, while Ireland has a GDP per capita of $15,000. This doesn't necessarily mean that the average Irish person is 10 times better off than the average Chinese person. GDP per capita doesn't account for how expensive it is to live in a country. Purchasing power parity (PPP) attempts to solve this problem by comparing how many goods and services an exchange-rate-adjusted unit of money can purchase in different countries â€“ comparing the price of an item, or basket of items, in two countries after adjusting for the exchange rate between the two, in effect. Real per capita GDP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is a heavily refined statistic to measure true income, which is an important element of well-being. An individual in Ireland might make $100,000 a year, while an individual in China might make $50,000 a year. In nominal terms, the worker in Ireland is better off. But if a year's worth of food, clothing and other items costs three times as much in Ireland than China, however, the worker in China has a higher real income.
