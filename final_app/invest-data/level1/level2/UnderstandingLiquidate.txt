 Understanding Liquidate . In the investments arena, liquidation occurs when an investor decides to close out his or her position in a particular asset or security. An investor that is long a stock may decide to sell some or all of the shares held in his portfolio for cash. Liquidating an asset is usually carried out when an investor or portfolio manager needs the cash to re-allocate funds or re-balance the portfolio. An asset that is not performing well in the markets may also be partially or fully liquidated to minimize or avoid losses. An investor who needs cash to fulfill other non-investment obligations, such as bill payments, vacation expenses, car purchase, tuition fees, etc. may opt to liquidate his assets. Financial advisors tasked with allocating assets to a portfolio usually consider, among other factors, why the investor wants to invest a certain amount of money and for how long the investor would like to invest for. An investor whose objective is to purchase a home five years from now, may have these a portfolio of stocks and bonds designed with the intention to liquidate in five years. The cash proceeds would then be used to make a down payment for a home. The financial advisor would keep that five year deadline in mind when selecting investments likely to appreciate and protect the capital for the investor.
