 Usefulness of Duration . Investors need to be aware of two main risks that can affect a bond's investment value: credit risk (default) and interest rate risk (interest rate fluctuations). Duration is used to quantify the potential impact these factors will have on a bond's price because both factors will affect a bond's expected YTM. For example, if a company begins to struggle and its credit quality declines, investors will require a greater reward or YTM to own the bonds. In order to raise the YTM of an existing bond, its price must fall. The same factors apply if interest rates are rising and competitive bonds are issued with a higher YTM.
