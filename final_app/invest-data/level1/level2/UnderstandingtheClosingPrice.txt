 Understanding the Closing Price . Closing prices are useful markers for investors to use to assess changes in stock prices over time. The closing price on one day can be compared to the closing price on the previous day, or 30 days earlier or a year earlier, to measure the changes in market sentiment towards that stock. All stock news sites allow investors to chart closing prices for a period of years, and typically since the day the company went public.
