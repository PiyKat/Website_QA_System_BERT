 Where Can I Get a CD? . Virtually every bank and credit union offers at least one certificate of deposit, and most have a wide array of terms on offer. So not only is your local brick-and-mortar bank an outlet, but so is every bank or credit union in your community, as well as every bank that accepts customers nationwide via the internet.  In addition, you can open CDs through your brokerage account. We’ll explain more on these later, but in short, these are bank certificates as well. Your brokerage firm simply serves as a middleman.
