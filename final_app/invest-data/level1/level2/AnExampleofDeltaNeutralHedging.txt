 An Example of Delta Neutral Hedging . Assume that you have a stock position that you believe will increase in price in the long term. You are worried, however, that prices could decline in the shortÂ term, so you decide to set up a delta neutral position. Assume that you own 200 shares of Company X, which is trading at $100 per share. Since the underlying stock's delta is 1, your current position has a delta of positive 200 (the delta multiplied by the number of shares). To obtain delta neutral position, you need to enter into a position that has a total delta of -200. Assume then you find at-the-money put options on Company X that are trading with a delta of -0.5. You could purchase 4 of these put options, which would have a total delta of (400 x -0.5), or -200. With this combined position of 200 Company X shares and 4 long at-the-money put options on Company X, your overall position is delta neutral.
