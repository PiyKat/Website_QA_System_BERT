 Impact of Dividends on Share Price . Since dividends are irreversible, their payments lead to money going out of the company’s books and accounts of the business forever. Therefore, dividend payments impact share price – it rises on the announcement approximately by the amount of dividend declared and declines by a similar amount at the opening session of the ex-date. Say a company is trading at $60 per share and it declares a $2 dividend on the announcement date. As soon as the news becomes public, the share price will shoot up by around $2 and hit $62. Say the stock trades at $63 one business day prior to the ex-date. On the ex-date, it will come down by a similar $2 and will start trading at $61 at the start of the trading session on the ex-date, because anyone buying on the ex-date will not receive the dividend.
