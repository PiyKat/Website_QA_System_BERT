 Systematic Withdrawal . By contrast, the basic tenet of the systematic withdrawal approach is that you invest across a broad spectrum of asset classes and withdraw a proportionate amount each month. In other words, it treats all of a client’s assets alike, subtracting the required income from the total. The fully diversified portfolio is regularly rebalanced to account for these regular withdrawals over time. There’s only a single asset allocation target to maintain and there are predictable 4% to 5% annual withdrawals. (For more, see: Why the 4% Retirement Rule Is No Longer Safe.)
