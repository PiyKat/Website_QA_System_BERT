 How a Second Mortgage Works . When most people purchase a home or property, they take out a home loan from a lending institution that uses the property as collateral. This home loan is called a mortgage, or more specifically, a first mortgage. The borrower is required to repay the loan in monthly installments made up of a portion of the principal amount and interest payments. Over time, as the homeowner makes good on his monthly payments, the value of the home also appreciates economically. The difference between the current market value of the home and any remaining mortgage payments is called home equity. A homeowner may decide to borrow against his home equity to fund other projects or expenditures. The loan he takes out against his home equity is known as a second mortgage, as he already has an outstanding first mortgage. The second mortgage is a lump sum of payment made out to the borrower at the beginning of the loan. Like first mortgages, second mortgages must be repaid over a specified term at a fixed or variable interest rate, depending on the loan agreement signed with the lender. The loan must be paid off first before the borrower can take on another mortgage against his home equity.
