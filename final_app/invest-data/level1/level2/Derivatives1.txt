 Derivatives . A forward contract can be used for speculation as well as hedging, although its non-standardized nature makes it particularly apt for hedging. Forward contracts are traded over the counter, meaning between banks and brokers, since they are custom agreements between two parties. Since they're not traded on an exchange, forwards have a higher risk of counterparty default. As a result, forward contracts are not as easily available to retail traders and investors as futures contracts.
