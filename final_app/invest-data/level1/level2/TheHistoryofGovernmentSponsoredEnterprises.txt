 The History of Government-Sponsored Enterprises . The first GSE created was in the farming sector with the inception of Farm Credit System (FCS) in 1916. The Farm Credit System is a network of federally chartered borrower-owned lending institutions tasked with providing an accessible source of credit to farmers, ranchers, and others involved in agriculture. The FCS gets its huge funding capital from the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, which sells bonds on securities markets. Another farming GSE, Federal Agricultural Mortgage Association (Farmer Mac), was created in 1988 and guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest to agricultural bond investors. To stimulate the housing segment, in 1932, the government established the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) which is owned by over 8,000 community financial institutions. Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac were later chartered in 1938, 1968, and 1970, respectively. The housing GSEs purchase mortgages from lenders on the secondary mortgage markets. The proceeds from the sale are used by lenders to provide more credit to borrowers or mortgagors. SLM Corporation (Sallie Mae) was set up in 1972 to target the education sector. The establishment originally serviced and collected federal student loans on behalf of the Department of Education. It ended its ties to the government in 2004 and now offers student loans privately, along with advice on financing higher education and federal loan programs.
