 What is a Creation Unit . A creation unit is a block of new shares sold by an exchange-traded fund (ETF) company to a broker-dealer for sale on the open market. Creation unit blocks typically range from 25,000 to 600,000 shares. Broker-dealers buy the shares in either a cash purchaseÂ or an in-kind transaction.
