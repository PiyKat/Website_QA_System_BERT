 Regulation of Securities . In the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the public offer and sale of securities.  Public offerings, sales, and trades of U.S. securities must be registered and filed with the SEC's state securities departments. Self Regulatory Organizations (SROs) within the brokerage industry often take on regulatory positions as well. Examples of SROs include the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The definition of a security offering was established by the Supreme Court in a 1946 case. In its judgment, the court derives the definition of a security based on four criteria - the existence of an investment contract, the formation of a common enterprise, a promise of profits by the issuer, and use of a third party to promote the offering.
