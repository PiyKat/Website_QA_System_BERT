 BREAKING DOWN Lambda . Lambda changes when there are large price movements, or increased volatility​​​​​​​, in the underlying asset. For example, if the price of an option moves higher by 10% as volatility rises 5%, then its lambda value is 2.0. Lambda is calculated by the price move divided by the volatility rise. If lambda is high, the option value is very sensitive to small changes in volatility. If lambda is low, changes in volatility will not have much of an effect on the option. A positive lambda is associated with a long option and means that the option becomes more valuable as volatility increases. Conversely, a negative lambda is associated with a short option and means the option becomes more valuable as volatility decreases.  Lambda is one of the most important options Greeks.
