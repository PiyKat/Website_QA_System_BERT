 The Formula for Measuring Inflation . The above-mentioned variants of inflation indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months (or years). While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portal and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology to ensure accuracy with a clear understanding of the calculations. Mathematically, The rise in Inflation = (Final CPI Index Value/Initial CPI Value) Say you wish to know how the purchasing power of $10,000 changed between Sept. 1975 and Sept. 2018. One can find inflation index data on various portals in a tabular form. From that table, pick up the corresponding CPI figures for of the given two months. For Sept. 1975, it was 54.6 (Initial CPI value) and for Sept. 2018, it was 252.439 (Final CPI value).﻿﻿ Plugging in the formula yields: Rise in Inflation = (252.439/54.6) = 4.6234 = 462.34% Since you wish to know how much $10,000 of Sept. 1975 would be in Sept. 2018, multiply the rise in inflation factor with the amount to get the changed dollar value: Change in dollar value = 4.6234 * $10,000 = 46,234.25
