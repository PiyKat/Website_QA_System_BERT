 Understanding Insurance Premiums . When you sign up for an insurance policy, your insurer will charge you a premium. This is the amount you pay for the policy or the total cost of your insurance. Policyholders may choose from a number of options for paying their insurance premiums. Some insurers allow the policyholder to pay the insurance premium in installments—monthly or semi-annually—while others may require an upfront payment in full before coverage starts.
