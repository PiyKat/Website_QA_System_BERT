 Macaulay Duration Calculation Example . Imagine a three-year bond with a face value of $100 that pays a 10% coupon semi-annually ($5 every six months) and has a yield to maturity (YTM) of 6%. In order to find the Macaulay duration, the first step will be to use this information to find the present value of all the future cash flows as shown in the following table: This part of the calculation is important to understand. However, it is not necessary if you already know the YTM for the bond and its current price. This is true because, by definition, the current price of a bond is the present value of all its cash flows. To complete the calculation, an investor needs to take the present value of each cash flow, divide it by the total present value of all the bond's cash flows and then multiply the result by the time to maturity in years. This calculation is easier to understand in the following table: The "Total" row of the table tells an investor that this three-year bond has a Macaulay duration of 2.684 years. Traders know that, the longer the duration is, the more sensitive the bond will be to changes in interest rates. If the YTM rises, the value of a bond with 20 years to maturity will fall further than the value of a bond with five years to maturity. How much the bond's price will change for each 1% the YTM rises or falls is called modified duration.
