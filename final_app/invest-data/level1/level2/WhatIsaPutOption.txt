 What Is a Put Option? . A put option is a contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified timeÂ frame. The specified price the put option buyer can sell at is called the strike price. Put options are traded on various underlying assets, including stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, and indexes. A put can be contrasted with a call option, which gives the holder to buy the underlying at a specified price on or before expiration. They are key to understanding when choosing whether to perform a straddle or a strangle.
