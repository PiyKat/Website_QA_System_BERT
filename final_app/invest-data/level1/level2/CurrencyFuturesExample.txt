 Currency Futures Example . Assume hypothetical company XYZ, which is based in the United States, is heavily exposed to foreign exchange risk and wishes to hedge against its projected receipt of 125 million euros in September. Prior to September, the company could sell futures contracts on the euros they will be receiving. Euro FX futures have a contract unit of 125,000 euros. They sell euro futures because they are a US company, and don't need the euros. Therefore, since they know they will receive euros, they can sell them now and lock in a rate at which those euros can be exchanged for US dollars.  Company XYZ sells 1,000 futures contracts on the euro to hedge its projected receipt. Consequently, if the euro depreciates against the US dollar, the company's projected receipt is protected. They locked in their rate, so they get to sell their euros at the rate they locked in. However, the company forfeits any benefits that would occur if the euro appreciates. They are still forced to sell their euros at the price of the futures contract, which means giving up the gain (relative to the price in August) they would have had if they had not sold the contracts.
