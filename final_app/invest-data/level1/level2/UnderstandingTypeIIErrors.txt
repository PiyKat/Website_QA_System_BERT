 Understanding Type II Errors . A type II error confirms an idea that should have been rejected, claiming the two observances are the same, even though they are different. A type II error does not reject the null hypothesis, even though the alternative hypothesis is the true state of nature. In other words, a false finding is accepted as true. A type II error is sometimes called a beta error. A type II error can be reduced by making more stringent criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis. For instance, if an analyst is considering anything that falls within a +/- 95% confidence interval as statistically significant, by increasing that tolerance to +/- 99% you reduce the chances of a false positive. However, doing so at the same time increases your chances of encountering a type I error. When conducting a hypothesis test, the probability or risk of making a type I error or type II error should be considered.
