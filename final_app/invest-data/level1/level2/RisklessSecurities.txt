 Riskless Securities . Riskless securities often form a baseline for analyzing and measuring risk. These types of investments offer an expected rate of return with very little or no risk. Oftentimes, all types of investors will look to these securities for preserving emergency savings or for holding assets that need to be immediately accessible. Examples of riskless investments and securities include certificates of deposits (CDs), money market accounts, U.S. Treasuries, and municipal securities. U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Investors can place money in multiple U.S. Treasury securities with different maturity options across the Treasury yield curve.
