 Reading Standard Income Statements . The focus in this standard format is to calculate the profit/income at each subhead of revenue and operating expenses and then account for mandatory taxes, interest, and other non-recurring, one-time events to arrive at the net income that is applicable to common stock. Though calculations involve simple additions and subtractions, the order in which the various entries appear in the statement and their relations often gets repetitive and complicated. Let’s take a deep dive into these numbers for better understanding. The first section titled “Revenue” indicates that Microsoft’s Gross (annual) Profit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, was $72.007 billion. It was arrived at by deducting the cost of revenue ($38.353 billion) from the total revenue ($110.360 billion) realized by the technology giant during its fiscal year. Around 35% of Microsoft’s total sales went toward costs for revenue generation, while a similar figure for Walmart was around 75% ($373.396/$500.343). It indicates that Walmart incurred much higher cost compared to Microsoft to generate equivalent sales. The next section called “Operating Expenses” again takes into account the cost of revenue ($38.353 billion) and total revenue ($110.360 billion) to arrive at the reported figures. As Microsoft spent $14.726 billion on research and development (R&D) and $22.223 billion on Selling General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) the Total Operating Expenses is computed by summing all these figures ($38.353 + $14.726 + $22.223) = $75.302 billion. Reducing the total operating expenses from total revenue leads to Operating Income (or Loss) as ($110.360 - $75.302) = $35.058 billion. This figure represents the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) for its core business activities and is again used later to derive the net income. A comparison of the line items indicates that Walmart did not spend anything on R&D, and had higher SGA and total operating expenses compared to Microsoft.
