 Why Intervene? . Foreign exchange intervention comes in two flavors. Firstly, a central bank or government may assess that its currency has slowly become out of sync with the country's economy and is having adverse affects on it. For example, countries that are heavily reliant on exports may find that their currency is too strong for other countries to afford the goods they produce. They may intervene to keep the currency in line with the currencies of the countries which export their goods. One example of this kind of intervention occurred by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) from September 2011 to January 2015. The SNB set a minimum exchange rate between the Swiss Franc and the Euro. This kept the Swiss Franc from strengthening beyond an acceptable level for other European importers of Swiss goods. This was successful for three and half years but then the SNB determined that it had to let the Swiss Franc float freely and without prior warning they released the minimum exchange rate. This had highly negative consequences to some businesses, but generally the Swiss economy has been unfazed by the intervention. Secondly, intervention can be a short-term reactionary to a certain event. Often, times a one-off event may cause a countries currency to move in one direction in a very short space of time. Central banks will intervene with the sole purpose of providing liquidity and reducing volatility. After the SNB lifted the floor in its currency against the Euro, the Swiss franc plummeted by as much as 25 percent. The SNB intervened in the short term to stop the Franc from falling further and curb the volatility.
