 Example of a Call Auction . Suppose a stock ABC's price is to be determined using a call auction. There are three buyers for the stock - X, Y and Z. X has placed an order to buy 10,000 ABC shares for $10 while Y and Z have placed orders for 5,000 shares and 2,500 shares at $8 and $12 respectively. Since X has the maximum number of orders, she will win the bid and the stock will be sold for $10 at the exchange. Y and Z will also pay the same price as X. A similar process can be used to determine the selling price of a stock. Examples of strategies using calls and puts include the seagull option.
