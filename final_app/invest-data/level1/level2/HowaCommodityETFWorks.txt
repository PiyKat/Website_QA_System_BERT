 How a Commodity ETF Works . ETFs usually consist of public equities that relate to a specific economy, market index, sector, or industry. Normal ETFs are made up of a collection of securities that are linked by a similar investment profile. Instead of underlying securities like public stocks, commodity ETFs are comprised of futures or asset-backed contracts that track the performance of a particular commodity or group of commodities. When an investor purchases a commodity ETF, they normally do not own the physical asset but instead own a set of contracts backed by the commodity itself. Since many commodity ETFs use leverage through the purchase of derivative contracts, they may have large portions of uninvested cash, which is used to purchase Treasury securities or other nearly risk-free assets. Commodity funds often create their own benchmark indexes that may include only agricultural products, natural resources or metals. As such, there is often tracking error around broader commodity indexes like the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. Even so, any commodity ETF should be passively invested in once the underlying index methodology is in place. Commodity ETFs have soared in popularity because they give investors exposure to commodities without requiring investors to learn how to purchase futures or other derivative products.
