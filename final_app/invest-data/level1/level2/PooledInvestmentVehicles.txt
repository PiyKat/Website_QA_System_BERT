 Pooled Investment Vehicles . Multiple investors often pool their money to gain certain advantages they would not have as individual investors; this is known as a pooled investment vehicle and can take the form of mutual funds, pension funds, private funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), and hedge funds.  In a mutual fund, a professional fund manager chooses the type of stocks, bonds, and other assets that should compose the client's portfolio. The fund manager charges a fee for this service.  A pension plan is a retirement account established by an employer into which an employee pays part of their income.  Private funds are composed of pooled investment vehicles, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and are not considered investment companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Unit investment trusts provide a fixed portfolio with a specified period of investment. The investments are sold as redeemable units.  Hedge funds group together client money to make what are often risky investments using a long and short strategy, leverage, and exotic securities in the aim of achieving higher than usual returns known as alpha.
