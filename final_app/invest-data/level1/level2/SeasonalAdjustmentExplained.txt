 Seasonal Adjustment Explained . Seasonal adjustments are intended to smooth out aberrations in certain types of financial activity. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses seasonal adjustment to achieve a more accurate portrait of employment and unemployment levels in the United States. They do this by removing the influence of seasonal events, such as the holidays, weather events, school schedules, and even the harvest period. Seasonal events are temporary, usually have a known length, and they tend to follow a generally predictable pattern each year, at the same time of year. As a result, seasonal adjustments can remove their influence on statistical trends. Adjustments allow statisticians to more easily observe nonseasonal and underlying trends and cycles and get an accurate and useful view of the labor market and buying habits. These adjustments are estimates based on seasonal activity in previous years.
