 Simple Delta . At this point, you might be wondering what these delta values are telling you. Let's use the following example to help illustrate the concept of simple delta and the meaning of these values. If an S&P 500 call option has a delta of 0.5 (for a near or at-the-money option), a one-point move (which is worth $250) of the underlying futures contract would produce a 0.5 (or 50%) change (worth $125) in the price of the call option. A delta value of 0.5, therefore, tells you that for every $250 change in the value of the underlying futures, the option changes in value by about $125. If you were long this call option and the S&P 500 futures move up by one point, your call option would gain approximately $125 in value, assuming no other variables change in the short run. We say "approximately" because as the underlying moves, delta will change as well. Be aware that as the option gets further in the money, delta approaches 1.00 on a call and –1.00 on a put. At these extremes, there is a near or actual one-for-one relationship between changes in the price of the underlying and subsequent changes in the option price. In effect, at delta values of –1.00 and 1.00, the option mirrors the underlying in terms of price changes. Also, keep in mind that this simple example assumes no change in other variables like the following:
