 Vanilla Option Features . Every option has a strike price. If the strike price is better than the price in the underlying market at maturity, the option is deemed "in the money" and can be exercised by its owner. A European style option requires the option be in the money on the expiration date in order for it to be exercised; an American style option can be exercised if it is in the money on or before the expiration date. The premium is the price paid to own the option. The premium is based on how close the strike is to the price of the underlying (in the money, out of the money, or at the money), the volatility of the underlying asset, and the time until expiration. Higher volatility and a longer maturity increase the premium. An option gains intrinsic value, or moves into the money, as the underlying surpasses the strike price— above the strike for a call and below the strike for a put.  Option traders don't need to wait until expiry to close out an options trade, nor do they need to exercise the option. They can take an offsetting position at any time to close the options trade and realize their profit or loss on the option.
