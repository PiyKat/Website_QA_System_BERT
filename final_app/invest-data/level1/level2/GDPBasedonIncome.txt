 GDP Based on Income . Considering that the other side of the spending coin is income, and since your expense is somebody else’s income, another approach to calculating GDP—something of an intermediary between the two other approaches—is the income approach. Income earned by all the factors of production in an economy includes the wages paid to labor, the rent earned by land, the return on capital in the form of interest, as well as corporate profits.  The income approach factors in some adjustments for some items that don’t show up in these payments made to factors of production. For one, there are some taxes—such as sales taxes and property taxes—that are classified as indirect business taxes. In addition, depreciation, which is a reserve that businesses set aside to account for the replacement of equipment that tends to wear down with use, is also added to the national income. All this constitutes national income, which is used both as an indicator of implied production and of implied expenditure.
