 Indexes as Benchmarks . As a hypothetical portfolio of holdings, indexes act as benchmark comparisons for a variety of purposes across the financial markets. As mentioned, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are three popular U.S. indices. These three indexes include the 30 largest stocks in the U.S. by market cap, the 500 largest stocks and all of the stocks on the Nasdaq exchange, respectively. Since they include some of the most significant U.S. stocks, these benchmarks can be a good representation of the overall U.S. stock market. Other indexes have more specific characteristics that create a more narrowly targeted market focus. Indexes can represent micro-sectors or maturity in the case of fixed income. Indexes can also be created to represent a geographic segment of the market such as those that track the emerging markets or stocks in the United Kingdom and Europe, such as the FTSE 100. Investors may choose to build a portfolio with diversified exposure to several indexes or individual holdings from a variety of indexes. They may also use benchmark values and performance to follow investments by segment. Some investors will allocate their investment portfolios based on the returns or expected returns of certain segments. Further, a specific index may act as a benchmark for a portfolio or a mutual fund.
