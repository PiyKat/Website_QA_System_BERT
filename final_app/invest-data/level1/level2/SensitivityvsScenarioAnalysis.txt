 Sensitivity vs. Scenario Analysis . In finance, a sensitivity analysis is created to understand the impact a range of variables have on a given outcome. It is important to note that a sensitivity analysis is not the same as a scenario analysis. As an example, assume an equity analyst wants to do a sensitivity analysis and a scenario analysis around the impact of earnings per share (EPS) on a company's relative valuation by using the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. The sensitivity analysis is based on the variables that affect valuation, which a financial model can depict using the variables' price and EPS. The sensitivity analysis isolates these variables and then records the range of possible outcomes. On the other hand, for a scenario analysis, the analyst determines a certain scenario such as a stock market crash or change in industry regulation. He then changesÂ the variables within the model to align with that scenario. Put together, the analyst has a comprehensive picture. He now knows the full range of outcomes, given all extremes, and has an understanding of what the outcomes would be, given a specific set of variables defined by real-life scenarios.
