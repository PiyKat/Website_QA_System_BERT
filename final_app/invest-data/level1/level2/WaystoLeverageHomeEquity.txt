 Ways to Leverage Home Equity . Unlike other investments, home equity cannot be quickly converted into cash. The equity calculation is based on a current market value appraisal of your property. However, that appraisal is no guarantee that the property would sell at that price.  An owner would have the possibility to leverage their home equity in the form of collateral to attain either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), or fixed-rate HELOC. A home equity loan, sometimes referred to as a second mortgage loan, usually allows you to borrow a lump sum against your current home equity for a fixed rate over a fixed period of time. Many home equity loans are used to finance large expenditures like home repairs or college tuition. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a revolving line of credit usually with an adjustable interest rate which allows you to borrow up to a certain amount over a period of time. HELOCs work in a manner similar to credit cards where and you can continuously borrow up to an approved limit while paying off the balance.
