 Are Dividends Irrelevant? . Economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued that a company's dividend policy is irrelevant and it has no effect on the price of a firm's stock or its cost of capital. Theoretically, a shareholder may remain indifferent to a company’s dividend policy. In the case of high dividend payments, they can use the cash received to buy more shares. In the case of low payments, they can sell some shares to get the necessary cash they need. In either case, the combination of the value of an investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain the same. Miller and Modigliani thus conclude that dividends are irrelevant, and investors shouldn’t care about the firm's dividend policy since they can create their own synthetically. However, in reality, dividends allow money to be made available to shareholders, which gives them the liberty to derive more utility out of it. They can invest in another financial security and reap higher returns, or spend on leisure and other utilities. Additionally, costs like taxes, brokerages, and indivisible shares make dividends a considerable utility in the real world. Dividends can help to offset costs from your broker and your taxes. This can make dividend investments even more attractive. Of course, to get invested in dividend-earning assets, one would need a stockbroker.
