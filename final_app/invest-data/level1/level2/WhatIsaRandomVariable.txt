 What Is a Random Variable? . A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes. Random variables are often designated by letters and can be classified as discrete, which are variables that have specific values, or continuous, which are variables that can have any values within a continuous range. Random variables are often used in econometric or regression analysis to determine statistical relationships among one another.
