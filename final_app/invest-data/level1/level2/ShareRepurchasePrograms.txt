 Share Repurchase Programs . Often times, if a company considers its stock to be undervalued, it will institute a repurchase program, buying back shares of its own stock. In an effort to increase the market value of remaining shares and elevate overall earnings per share, the company may reduce the number of shares outstanding by repurchasing, or buying back those shares, thus taking them off the open market. Take, for example, Apple, Inc., whose outstanding securities have a large institutional ownership of about 62%. In March 2012, Apple announced a buyback program, several times since renewed, of upwards of $90 billion. According to the New York Times, the “primary purpose [of the repurchase] will be to eliminate the shareholder dilution that will occur from future Apple employee equity grants and stock purchase programs.” Due to its enormous cash reserves, Apple has been able to repurchase its stock aggressively, thus decreasing shares outstanding increasing its earnings per share. As of December 2015, Apple’s market cap is $869.60 billion and it has 5.18 billion outstanding shares. The stock price is up nearly $170 since the buyback program was announced. Conversely, in May 2015, BlackBerry, Ltd. announced a plan to repurchase 12 million of its own outstanding shares in an effort to increase stock earnings. BlackBerry plans to buy back 2.6% of its more than 500 million outstanding float shares as an increase in equity incentive. Unlike Apple, whose excessive cash flow allows the company to spend exorbitantly to bring in future earnings, BlackBerry’s dwindling growth suggests that its repurchase of outstanding shares comes in preparation for its cancellation.
