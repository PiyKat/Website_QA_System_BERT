 Why You Should Be Open to Odd-Term CDs . Whether you’re building a CD ladder or are saving towards a specific goal with a known timeline, stay open-minded to the very best CD deals you find rather than getting hung up on a specific term. The reason this is important is that, when some banks and credit unions offer a promotional CD to attract new customers, they may stipulate an unconventional term. For instance, some of the best CD rates you’ll see have unlikely terms like 5 months, 17 months, or 21 months. It may be to stand out or, perhaps, to match the birthday the bank is celebrating, or any number of other reasons. But if you can be flexible in considering these odd-term certificates instead of the conventional term you were planning, you can sometimes find yourself with a better-paying opportunity.
