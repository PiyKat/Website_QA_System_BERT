 A Simplified Measure of Volatility . Fortunately, there is a much easier and more accurate way to measure and examine risk, through a process known as the historical method. To utilize this method, investors simply need to graph the historical performance of their investments, by generating a chart known as a histogram. A histogram is a chart that plots the proportion of observations that fall within a host of category ranges. For example, in the chart below, the three-year rolling annualized average performance of the S&P 500 Index for the period of June 1, 1979, through June 1, 2009, has been constructed. The vertical axis represents the magnitude of the performance of the S&P 500 Index, and the horizontal axis represents the frequency in which the S&P 500 Index experienced such performance. Figure 1: S&P 500 Index Performance Histogram Source: Investopedia 2009 As the chart illustrates, the use of a histogram allows investors to determine the percent of time in which the performance of an investment is within, above, or below a given range. For example, 16% of the S&P 500 Index performance observations achieved a return between 9% and 11.7%. In terms of performance below or above a threshold, it can also be determined that the S&P 500 Index experienced a loss greater than or equal to 1.1%, 16% of the time, and performance above 24.8%, 7.7% of the time.
