 Example of a Stock Pick . Jay is an investment analyst with a firm and he is focused on the tech sector. Jay picks the stock of company ABC, which is a social media network, as his pick after careful analysis. He considers a number of factors while analyzing ABC's stock. These include the company's revenues and profits during the previous year and the current regulatory climate for tech companies across various jurisdictions. He notes that ABC is in hot water in some of the geographies it operates in but that those problems will not have a significant impact on its bottom line. ABC has also diversified away from its core product to include offerings that span a range of emerging technologies. As a result, even if the company loses market share in social media, it has other sources of revenue to mitigate those losses.
