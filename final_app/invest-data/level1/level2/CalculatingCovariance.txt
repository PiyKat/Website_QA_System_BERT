 Calculating Covariance . Calculating a stock's covariance starts with finding a list of previous prices or "historical prices" as they are called on most quote pages. Typically, you use the closing price for each day to find the return. To begin the calculations, find the closing price for both stocks and build a list. For example: Next, we need to calculate the average return for each stock: This is represented by the following equation: ﻿Covariance=∑(ReturnABC − AverageABC) ∗ (ReturnXYZ − AverageXYZ)(Sample Size) − 1\text{Covariance}=\frac{\sum{\left(Return_{ABC}\text{ }-\text{ }Average_{ABC}\right)\text{ }*\text{ }\left(Return_{XYZ}\text{ }-\text{ }Average_{XYZ}\right)}}{\left(\text{Sample Size}\right)\text{ }-\text{ }1}Covariance=(Sample Size) − 1∑(ReturnABC​ − AverageABC​) ∗ (ReturnXYZ​ − AverageXYZ​)​﻿ Using our example of ABC and XYZ above, the covariance is calculated as: = [(1.1 - 1.30) x (3 - 3.74)] + [(1.7 - 1.30) x (4.2 - 3.74)] + [(2.1 - 1.30) x (4.9 - 3.74)] + … = [0.148] + [0.184] + [0.928] + [0.036] + [1.364]
