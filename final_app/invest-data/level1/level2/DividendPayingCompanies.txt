 Dividend Paying Companies . Larger, established companies with more predictable profits are often the best dividend payers. These companies tend to issue regular dividends as they seek to maximize shareholder wealth in ways aside from normal growth. Companies in the following industry sectors are observed to be maintaining a regular record of dividend payments: basic materials, oil and gas, banks and financial, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and utilities. Companies structured as master limited partnerships (MLP) and real estate investment trusts (REIT) are also top dividend payers since their designations require specified distributions to shareholders. Funds may also issue regular dividend payments as stated in their investment objectives. Start-ups and other high-growth companies, such as those in the technology or biotech sectors, may not offer regular dividends. Since such companies may be in the early stages of development and may incur high costs (as well as losses) attributed to research and development, business expansion and operational activities, they may not have sufficient funds to issue dividends. Even profit-making early- to mid-stage companies avoid making dividend payments if they are aiming for higher-than-average growth and expansion, and may like to invest the profits back in business instead of paying dividends.
