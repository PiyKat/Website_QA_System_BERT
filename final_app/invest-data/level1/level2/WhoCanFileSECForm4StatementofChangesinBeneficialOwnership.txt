 Who Can File SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership? . This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market, as well as the exercise of company stock options.

This filing is related to the Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
