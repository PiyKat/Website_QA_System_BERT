 What Is a Type II Error? . A type II error is a statistical term referring to the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis. It is used within the context of hypothesis testing. In statistical analysis, a type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis, whereas type II error describes the error that occurs when one fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. In other words, it produces a false positive. The error rejects the alternative hypothesis, even though it does not occur due to chance.
