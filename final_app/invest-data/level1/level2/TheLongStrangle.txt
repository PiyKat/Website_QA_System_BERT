 The Long Strangle . A long strangle involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of a put and call at differing strike prices. How the different strike prices are determined is beyond the scope of this article. A myriad of choices that revolve around volatility, overbought/oversold indicators, or moving averages can be used. In the example below, we see that the euro has developed some support at the $1.54 area and resistance at the $1.5660 area. Source: TradeNavigator.com A long-strangle trader can purchase a call with the strike price of $1.5660 and a put with the strike price of $1.54. If the market breaks through the $1.5660 price, the call goes ITM; if it collapses and breaks through $1.54, the put goes ITM. In the follow-up chart, we see that the market breaks to the upside, straight through $1.5660, making the OTM call profitable. Depending on how much the put option costs, it can either be sold back to the market to collect any built-in premium or held until expiration to expire without worth. Source: TradeNavigator.com
