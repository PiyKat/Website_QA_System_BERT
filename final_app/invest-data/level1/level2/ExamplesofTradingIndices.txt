 Examples of Trading Indices . The Standard & Poor's 500 is one of the world's best-known indices and one of the most commonly used benchmarks for the stock market. It includes 75% of the total stocks traded in the United States. Conversely, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is also a very well-known index, but it only represents stock values from 30 of the nation's publicly traded companies. Other prominent indices include the Nasdaq; the Wilshire 5000; the MSCI EAFE, which includes foreign stocks based in Europe, Australasia and the Far East; and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, now known as Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index.
