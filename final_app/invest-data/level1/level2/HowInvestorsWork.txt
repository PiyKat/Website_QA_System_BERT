 How Investors Work . Investors are not a uniform bunch. They have varying risk tolerances, capital, styles, preferences and time frames. For instance, some investors may prefer very low-risk investments that will lead to conservative gains, such as certificates of deposits and certain bond products. Other investors, however, are more inclined to take on additional risk in an attempt to make a larger profit. These investors might invest in currencies, emerging markets or stocks, all while dealing with a roller coaster of different factors on a daily basis. A distinction can be made between the terms "investor" and "trader" in that investors typically hold positions for years to decades (also called a "position trader" or "buy and hold investor") while traders generally hold positions for shorter periods. Scalp traders, for example, hold positions for as little as a few seconds. Swing traders, on the other hand, seek positions that are held from several days to several weeks. Institutional investors are organizations such as financial firms or mutual funds that invest in stocks and other financial instruments and build sizable portfolios. Often, they are able to accumulate and pool money from several smaller investors (individuals and/or firms) in order to take larger investments. Because of this, institutional investors often have far greater market power and influence than individual retail investors.
