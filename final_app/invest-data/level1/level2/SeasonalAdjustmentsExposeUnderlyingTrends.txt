 Seasonal Adjustments Expose Underlying Trends . Seasonal movements can be substantial, so much so that they can often obscure other traits and trends in the data. If seasonal adjustments are not made, analyses of the data cannot yield accurate results. If each period in a time series—for example, each month in the fiscal year—has a different tendency toward low or high seasonal values, it can be difficult to detect the true direction of the underlying trends of the time series. Difficulties include increases or decreases in economic activity, turning points, and other economic indicators.
