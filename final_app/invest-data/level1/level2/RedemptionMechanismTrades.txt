 Redemption Mechanism Trades . ETF creation units and redemption units rely on transactions that involve the underlying securities in exchange for ETF shares. If an authorized participant wants to contract with an ETF issuer for creation units of ETF shares, they will buy the underlying securities in the open market and transact them in-kind for the ETF shares in a creation unit. This can be called the creation mechanism. Similarly if an authorized participant wants to redeem shares, they do so for an in-kind transaction,Â receiving the underlying securities in exchange for the ETF shares. Authorized participants and ETF issuers have comprehensive access to the financial markets for transacting creation and redemption units with in-kind shares. The in-kind transaction mechanism involved with the creation and redemption of ETF shares is what keeps ETF shares trading more closely in line with their accounting NAV.
