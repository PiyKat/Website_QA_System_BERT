July 3, 1884 . The date that the world's first stock index, the Dow Jones Transportation Index, was published by Charles Dow. The index was made up of 11 transportation stocks, including nine railway companies.  Institutional fund managers also use indexes as a basis for creating index funds. Individual investors cannot invest in an index without buying each of the individual holdings which is generally too expensive from a trading perspective. Therefore, index funds are offered as a low-cost way for investors to invest in a comprehensive index portfolio, gaining exposure to a specific market segment of their choosing. Index funds use an index replication strategy which buys and holds all of the constituents in an index. Some management and trading costs are still included in the fund’s expense ratio but the costs are much lower than fees for an actively managed fund.
