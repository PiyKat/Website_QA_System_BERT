 Least Squares Regression Line . If the data shows a leaner relationship between two variables, the line that best fits this linear relationship is known as a least squares regression line, which minimizes the vertical distance from the data points to the regression line. The term “least squares” is used because it is the smallest sum of squares of errors, which is also called the "variance".
