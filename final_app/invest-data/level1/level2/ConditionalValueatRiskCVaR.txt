 Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) . Conditional value at risk (CVaR) is another risk measure used to assess the tail risk of an investment. Used as an extension to the VaR, the CVaR assesses the likelihood, with a certain degree of confidence, that there will be a break in the VaR; it seeks to assess what happens to investment beyond its maximum loss threshold. This measure is more sensitive to events that happen in the tail end of a distributionâ€”the tail risk. For example, suppose a risk manager believes the average loss on an investment is $10 million for the worst one percent of possible outcomes for a portfolio. Therefore, the CVaR, or expected shortfall, is $10 million for the one percent tail.
