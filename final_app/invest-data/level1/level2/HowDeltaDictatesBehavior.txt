 How Delta Dictates Behavior . Delta is an important calculation (done by computer software), as it is one of the main reasons option prices move the way that they do, and it's an indicator of how to invest. The behavior of call and put option delta is highly predictable and is very useful to portfolio managers, traders, hedge fund managers, and individual investors. Call option delta behavior depends on whether the option is "in-the-money" (currently profitable), "at-the-money" (itsÂ strike price currently equals the underlying stock's price) or "out-of-the-money" (not currently profitable). In-the-money call options get closer to 1 as their expiration approaches. At-the-money call options typically have a delta of 0.5, and the delta of out-of-the-money call options approaches 0 as expiration nears. The deeper in-the-money the call option, the closer the delta will be to 1, and the more the option will behave like the underlying asset. Put option delta behaviors also depend on whether the option is "in-the-money," "at-the-money" or "out-of-the-money" and are the opposite of call options. In-the-money put options get closer to -1 as expiration approaches. At-the-money put options typically have a delta of -0.5, and the delta of out-of-the-money put options approaches 0 as expiration approaches. The deeper in-the-money the put option, the closer the delta will be to -1.
