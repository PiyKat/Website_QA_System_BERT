 Example of How PIK Notes Work . To illustrate how payment-in-kind notes work, imagine a financier offers a struggling company payment-in-kind notes worth $2 million. The notes have a 10% interest rate and they mature at the end of a ten year period. Each year, the note incurs $200,000 in interest. However, instead of being required to repay that amount or any principal payments, the interest is added to the debt in kind, meaning more debt. As a result, by the end of the first year, the company owes $2.2 million and that amount continues to grow until the loan matures, at which time the cash is due.
