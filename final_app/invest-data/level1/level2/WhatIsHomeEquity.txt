 What Is Home Equity? . Home equity is the value of the homeowner’s interest in their home. In other words, it is the real property’s current market value less any liens that are attached to that property. The amount of equity in a house or its value fluctuates over time as payments are made on the mortgage and market forces play on the current value of that property.
