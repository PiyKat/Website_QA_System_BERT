 Rate of Change and Its Relationship With Price . The rate of change is most often used to measure the change in a security's price over time. This is also known as the price rate of change (ROC). The price rate of change can be derived by taking the price of a security at time B minus the price of the same security at time A and dividing that result by the price at time A. ﻿Price ROC=B−AA×100where:B=price at current timeA=price at previous time\begin{aligned} &\text{Price ROC} = \frac{B - A}{A} \times 100 \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &B=\text{price at current time}\\ &A=\text{price at previous time}\\ \end{aligned}​Price ROC=AB−A​×100where:B=price at current timeA=price at previous time​﻿ This is important because many traders pay close attention to the speed at which one price changes relative to another. For example, option traders study the relationship between the rate of change in the price of an option relative to a small change in the price of the underlying asset, known as an options delta.
