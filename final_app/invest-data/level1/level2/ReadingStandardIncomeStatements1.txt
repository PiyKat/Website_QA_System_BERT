 Reading Standard Income Statements . The next section titled “Income from Continuing Operations” adds net other income or expenses (like one time earnings), interest-linked expenses and applicable taxes to arrive at the Net Income From Continuing Operations ($16.571 billion) for Microsoft, which is 60% higher than that of Walmart ($10.523 billion). After discounting for any non-recurring events, the value of net income applicable to common shares is arrived at. Microsoft had a 68% higher net income of $16.571 billion compared to Walmart’s $9.862 billion. The earnings per share are computed by dividing the net income figure by the number of weighted average shares outstanding. With 7.7 billion outstanding shares of Microsoft, its EPS comes to $16.571 billion/7.7 billion = $2.15 per share. With Walmart having 2.995 billion outstanding shares, its EPS comes to $3.29 per share. Though the retail giant beats the technology leader in terms of annual EPS, Microsoft had a lower cost for generating equivalent revenue, higher net income from continuing operations, and higher net income applicable to common shares compared to Walmart.
