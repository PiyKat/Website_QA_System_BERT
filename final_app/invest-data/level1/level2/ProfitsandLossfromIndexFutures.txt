 Profits and Loss from Index Futures . An index futures contract states that the holder agrees to purchase an index at a particular price on a specified future date. Index futures typically settled quarterly, and there are several annual contracts as well. Equity index futures are cash settled meaning there's no delivery of the underlying asset at the end of the contract. If on expiry, the price of the index is higher than the agreed-upon price in the contract, the buyer has made a profit, and the seller—future writer—has suffered a loss. Should the opposite be true, the buyer suffers a loss, and the seller makes a profit. For example, if the Dow were to close at 16,000 at the end of September, the holder who bought a September future contact one year earlier at 15,760 would have a profit. Profits are determined by the difference between the entry and exit prices of the contract. As with any speculative trade, there are risks that the market could move against the position. As mentioned earlier, the trading account must keep funds or margin on hand and could have a margin call demand to offset any risk of further losses. Also, the investor or trader must understand that many factors can drive market index prices including macroeconomic conditions such as growth in the economy and corporate earnings or disappointments.
