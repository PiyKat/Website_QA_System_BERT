 Russell 1000 . The Russell 1000 is a relatively newer index, having started in 1984. It is also less well-known than the S&P 500, but it represents a similarly broad stock market performance. Administered by FTSE Russell, it is a subset of the broader Russell 3000 Index, which includes 3,000 stocks accounting for more than 98% of total stock market capitalization. The largest 1,000 stocks go into the Russell 1000 Index, and the smaller 2,000 go into the more well-known Russell 2000Â small-cap index. Stock prices change every minute of every business day. Therefore, publicly-traded company values are constantly changing, and it is up to an index's administrators to keep up with these changes to reflect the current times. The process of changing the weighting of assets in a portfolio is called rebalancing. However, the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 change on different schedules. The S&P 500 rebalances its portfolio on a quarterly basis, while the Russell 1000 is only rebalanced once a year at the end of the second quarter. Although it may not seem like a big issue, update frequency can affect how well mutual funds and ETFs benchmarked to the index can perform relative to the market. The slower an index rebalances, the longer it takes for it to be representative of the current market. The Russell 1000's mid-cap composition is shown by the median market capitalization of its stocks. The S&P 500 had a $22.28 billion median market cap, compared to the Russell 1000's $10.97 billion median market cap, as of April 30, 2019. This distinction is important because mid-cap stocks generally maintain a higher-risk, higher-return potential profile. Therefore, the Russell 1000 Index should be considered slightly more risky than the S&P 500. Closed-end funds, mutual funds, ETFs, and thinly traded stocks are ineligible for inclusion in either index. The only minor difference between the indices here is that Business Development Corporations (BDCs) are eligible for the S&P 500, but not for the Russell 1000.
