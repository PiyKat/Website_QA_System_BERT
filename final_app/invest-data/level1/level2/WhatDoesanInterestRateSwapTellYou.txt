 What Does an Interest Rate Swap Tell You? . In an interest rate swap, one party will be the payer and the other will be the recipient of the fixed rate. The cash flow of the fixed rate leg of the swap is set when the trade is undertaken. The cash flow for the floating rate leg is set periodically on the rate reset dates, which are determined by the reset period of the floating rate leg. The most common index for the floating rate leg is the three-month Libor. This can either be paid quarterly or compounded and paid semi-annually. The rate above or below the chosen Libor reflects the yield curve and credit spread to be charged. Interest rate payments between fixed and floating rate legs are netted at the end of each payment period and only the difference is exchanged.
