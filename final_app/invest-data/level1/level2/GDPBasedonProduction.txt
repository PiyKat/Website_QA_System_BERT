 GDP Based on Production . The production approach is something like the reverse of the expenditure approach. Instead of measuring input costs that feed economic activity, the production approach estimates the total value of economic output and deducts costs of intermediate goodsÂ that are consumed in the process, like those of materials and services. The expenditure approach projects forward from costs; the production approach looks backward from the vantage of a state of completed economic activity.
