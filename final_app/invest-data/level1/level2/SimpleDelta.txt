 Simple Delta . Let's review some basic concepts before jumping right into position delta. Delta is one of four major risk measures used by option traders. Delta measures the degree to which an option is exposed to shifts in the price of the underlying asset (i.e. stock) or commodity (i.e. futures contract). Values range from 1.0 to –1.0 (or 100 to –100, depending on the convention employed). For example, if you buy a call or a put option that is just out of the money (i.e. the strike price of the option is above the price of the underlying if the option is a call, and below the price of the underlying if the option is a put), then the option will always have a delta value that is somewhere between 1.0 and –1.0. Generally speaking, an at-the-money option usually has a delta at approximately 0.5 or -0.5. Figure 1: The four dimensions of risk - AKA, the "Greeks."
