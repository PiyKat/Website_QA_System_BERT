 What Is a Private Investment in Public Equity – PIPE? . Private investment in public equity (PIPE) is the buying of shares of publicly traded stock at a price below the current market value (CMV) per share. This buying method is a practice of investment firms, mutual funds, and other large, accredited investors. A traditional PIPE is one in which common or preferred stock is issued at a set price to the investor—a structured PIPE issues common or preferred shares of convertible debt. The purpose of a PIPE is for the issuer of the stock to raise capital for the public company. This financing technique is more efficient than secondary offerings, due to fewer regulatory issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
