 Cumulative Return and Mutual Funds . A common way to present the "effect" of a mutual fund's performance over time is to show the cumulative return with a visual such as a mountain graph. Investors should check to confirm whether interest and/or dividends are included in the cumulative return (the marketing materials or info accompanying an illustration should say); such payouts may be assumed to be reinvested or simply counted as raw dollars when calculating the cumulative return. One notable difference between mutual funds and stocks is mutual funds sometimes distribute capital gains to the fund holders. This distribution usually comes at the end of a calendar year and consists of the profits the portfolio managers made when closing out holdings. Mutual fund owners have the option to reinvest those capital gains, which can further make calculating the cumulative return more difficult.
