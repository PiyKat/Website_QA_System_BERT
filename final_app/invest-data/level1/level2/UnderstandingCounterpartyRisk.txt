 Understanding Counterparty Risk . Varying degrees of counterparty risk exists in all financial transactions. Counterparty risk is also known as default risk. Default risk is the chance that companies or individuals will be unable to make the required payments on their debt obligations. Lenders and investors are exposed to default risk in virtually all forms of credit extensions. Counterparty risk is a risk that both parties should consider when evaluating a contract. If one party has a higher risk of default, a premium is usually attached to the transaction to compensate the other party. The premium added due to counterparty risk is called a risk premium. In retail and commercial financial transactions, credit reports are often used by creditors to determine the counterparty's credit risk. Credit scores of borrowers are analyzed and monitored to gauge the level of risk to the creditor. A credit score is a numerical value of an individual's or company's creditworthiness, which is based on many variables. A person's credit score ranges from 300 to 850, and the higher the score, the more financially trustworthy a person is considered to be to the creditor. Numerical values of credit scores are listed below: Many factors impact a credit score including a client's payment history, the total amount of debt, length of credit history, and credit utilization, which is the percentage of a borrower’s total available credit that is currently being utilized. The numerical value of a borrower's credit score reflects the level of counterparty risk to the lender or creditor. A borrower with a credit score of 750 would have low counterparty risk while a borrower with a credit score of 450 would carry high counterparty risk.
