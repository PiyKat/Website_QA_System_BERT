 Real-World Example of a Random Variable . A typical example of a random variable is the outcome of a coin toss. Consider a probability distribution in which the outcomes of a random event are not equally likely to happen. If random variable, Y, is the number of heads we get from tossing two coins, then Y could be 0, 1, or 2. This means that we could have no heads, one head or both heads on a two-coin toss. However, the two coins land in four different ways: TT, HT, TH, HH. Therefore, the P(Y=0) = 1/4 since we have one chance of getting no heads (i.e., two tails [TT] when the coins are tossed). Similarly, the probability of getting two heads (HH) is also 1/4. Notice that getting one head has a likelihood of occurring twice: in HT and TH. In this case, P (Y=1) = 2/4 = 1/2.
