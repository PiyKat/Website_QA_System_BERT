 How the Index Is Calculated . Stocks with higher share prices are given greater weight in the index. So, a higher percentage move in a higher-priced component will have a greater impact on the final calculated value. At the Dow's inception, Charles Dow calculated the average by adding the prices of the twelve Dow component stocks and dividing by twelve with the end result being a simple average. Over time, there have been additions and subtractions to the index, such as mergers and stock splits that had to be accounted for whereby an arithmetic mean would not suffice any longer. This led to the advent of the Dow Divisor, a predetermined constant (though it can be changed if the need should arise) that is used to determine the effect of a one-point move in any of the thirty stocks that comprise the Dow. There have been instances (components added or removed, stock splits, etc.) when the divisor needed to be changed so that the value of DJIA stayed consistent. The current divisor can be found in the Wall Street Journal and is 0.14748071991788.  The key point about the DJIA is that it is not a weighted arithmetic average, nor does it represent its component companies' market capitalization as does the S&P 500. Rather, it reflects the sum of the price of one share of stock for all the components, divided by the divisor. Thus, a one-point move in any of the component stocks will move the index by an identical number of points. DJIA = SUM (Component stock prices) / Dow Divisor
