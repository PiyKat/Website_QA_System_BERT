 Calls and Puts . The option writer gets the $35 for writingÂ the option. If the price of XYZ stock stays below $31, the writer keeps the premium. If the price rises above $31, the option writer has an obligation to sell that stock to the option buyer at $31 even if the stock rises to $35. This would represent a loss of [(($35 - $31) x 100) - $35], or $365. Then the option is said to be out of the money.
