 Understanding an Economic Moat . Every successful company understands that the main threat to their continued success will be from competitors, and keeping them at bay is critical to sustaining their dominance. With the passage of time, they are likely to see an erosion to their bottom line as competitors eat away at their market share. Which is why a business that intends to remain dominant has to establish an economic moat. Economic moat describes a company's competitive advantage derived as a result of various business tactics that allow it to earn above-average profits for a sustainable period of time. This is important not only to the company's bottom line but also to potential investors seeking to maximize their portfolios by including companies that will maintain their performance edge. By establishing a defensible competitive advantage a company can fashion a wide enough economic moat that effectively curbs competition within their industry. Essentially, the wider the economic moat, the larger and more sustainable the competitive advantage of a firm. An intangible asset, such as a company crafting a well-known brand name (Nike), pricing power edge (Apple), cost advantages (Walmart), making it costly for customers to switch products (cell phone companies), efficient scale, and network effects are all advantages that businesses can utilize to create a wide economic moat. The most obvious financial characteristics that companies with a wide economic moat have is that they usually generate large amounts of free cash flow and have a track record of strong returns.
