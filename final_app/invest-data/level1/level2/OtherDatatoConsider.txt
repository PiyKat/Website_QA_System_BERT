 Other Data to Consider . While important, standard deviations should not be taken as an end-all measurement of the worth of an individual investment or a portfolio. For example, a mutual fund that returns between 5 percent and 7 percent every single year has a lower standard deviation than a competing fund that returns between 6 percent and 16 percent every year, but it is clearly an inferior choice with all other things being equal. It is important to note that standard deviation only shows the dispersion of annual returns for a mutual fund, which does not necessarily imply future consistency with this measurement. Economic factors such as interest rate changes can always affect the performance of a mutual fund. When assessing risk associated with a mutual fund, standard deviation is not a standalone answer. For example, standard deviation only shows consistency or inconsistency of returns but does not show how well the fund performs against its benchmark, which is measured as beta. Another potential weakness of relying on standard deviation to measure risk for a portfolio is that it assumes a bell-shaped distribution of data values. This means the equation indicates that the same probability exists for achieving values above the mean or below the mean. Many portfolios do not display this tendency, and hedge funds especially tend to be skewed in one direction or another. The more securities held in a portfolio, and the more variety in the different types of securities, the more likely standard deviation may not be appropriate. Also, as with any statistical model, large data sets are more reliable than small data sets. The 4.9 percent mean and 2.46 percent standard deviation in the example above is not as reliable as the same values produced from 50 different calculations instead of five.  (For related reading, see: What is the Difference Between Standard Deviation and Average Deviation?)
