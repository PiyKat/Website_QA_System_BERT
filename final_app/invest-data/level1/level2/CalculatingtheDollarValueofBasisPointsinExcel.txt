Calculating the Dollar Value of Basis Points in Excel . In the fixed income market, each instrument's smallest increment of movement is called a tick. Each variation cannot be lower than a tick, and it is determined according to the value of the instrument traded. For the market rate, the minimum unit is the basis point. If a rate goes from 2 to 2.1%, the rate will be increased by 10 basis points. The basis point corresponds to one-hundredth of 1%, or 0.01%. This term is frequently used in the monetary policy rate sector, where one does not speak of a percentage variation but basis points. Thus a rise in the interest rate from 1.3% to 1.35% does not increase by 3.84%, but by five basis points. It is common to hear media commentators state that such an increase corresponds to an increase of 0.05%. However, this is not the case; the increase is, in fact, five basis points up to 3.84%.
