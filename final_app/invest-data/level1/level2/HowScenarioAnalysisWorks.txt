 How Scenario Analysis Works . As a technique, scenario analysis involves computing different reinvestment rates for expected returns that are reinvested within the investment horizon. Based on mathematical and statistical principles, scenario analysis provides a process to estimate shifts in the value of a portfolio, based on the occurrence of different situations, referred to as scenarios, following the principles of "what if" analysis. These assessments can be used to examine the amount of risk present within a given investment as related to a variety of potential events, ranging from highly probable to highly improbable. Depending on the results of the analysis, an investor can determine if the level of risk present falls within his comfort zone. One type of scenario analysis that looks specifically at worst-case scenarios is stress testing. Stress testing is often employed using a computer simulation technique to test the resilience of institutions and investment portfolios against possible future critical situations. Such testing is customarily used by the financial industry to help gauge investment risk and the adequacy of assets, as well as to help evaluate internal processes and controls. In recent years, regulators have also required financial institutions to carry out stress tests to ensure their capital holdings and other assets are adequate.
