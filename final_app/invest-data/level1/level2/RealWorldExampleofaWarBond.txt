 Real World Example of a War Bond . Although War Bonds are not sold any longer, let's say as an example an investor purchased a War Bond and held it until its maturity in 10 years. The bond was purchased for $75 or at a discount to the $100 face value of the bond. The investor holds the bond for 10 years and is paid no interest payments over those 10 years. At maturity, the investor cashes in the bond and is paid the $100 face value.
