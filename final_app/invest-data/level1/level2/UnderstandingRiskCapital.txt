 Understanding Risk Capital . Risk capital is the funds that are expendable in exchange for the opportunity to generate outsized gains. Investors must be willing to lose all of their risk capital and it should only account for 10% or less of a typical investor's portfolio equity. Experienced investors with high risk tolerance may allocate a quarter or more of their portfolio to higher risk investment. That said, any investments made with risk capital should be offset with more stable diversified investments or you face the possibility of losing your entire portfolio. The more risk averse the investor, the lower the proportion of risk capital allocated in the total portfolio should be. While young investors, because of their lengthy investment horizons, can have a very significant proportion of risk capital in their portfolios, retirees are not usually comfortable with a high proportion of risk capital - nor should they be as their time to make back losses is limited. Generally speaking, speculative investingÂ should be segmented to the early years of investing and cordoned off as retirement age approaches.
