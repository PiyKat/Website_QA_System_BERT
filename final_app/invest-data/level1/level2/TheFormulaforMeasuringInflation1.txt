 The Formula for Measuring Inflation . To get the final dollar value of the end period, add the original dollar amount ($10,000) to the change in dollar value: Final dollar value = $10,000 + $46,234.25 = $56,234.25 This means that $10,000 in Sept. 1975 will be worth $56,234.25. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services (as included in the CPI definition) worth $10,000 in 1975, the same basket would cost you $56,234.25 in Sept. 2018.
