 Current Fiduciary Rules and Regulations . The Department of the Treasury's agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is in charge of regulating federal savings associations and their fiduciary activities. Multiple fiduciary duties may at times be in conflict with one another, a problem that often occurs with real estate agents and lawyers. Two opposing interests can at best be balanced; however, balancing interests is not the same as serving the best interest of a client.  Fiduciary certifications are distributed at the state level and can be revoked by the courts if a person is found to neglect their duties. To become certified, a fiduciary is required to pass an examination that tests their knowledge of laws, practices, and security-related procedures such as background checks and screening. While board volunteers do not require certification, due diligence includes making sure that professionals working in these areas have the appropriate certifications or licenses for the tasks they are performing.
