 Understanding Shareholder Equity  . Equity is important because it represents the value of an investor’s stake in securities or a company. Investors who hold stock in a company are usually interested in their personal equity in the company, represented by their shares. Yet this kind of personal equity is a function of the company's total equity. Owning stock in a company over time may yield capital gains or stock price appreciation as well as dividends for shareholders. Owning equity can also give shareholders the right to vote in any elections for the board of directors. These equity ownership benefits promote shareholders ongoing interest in the company. Equity represents the shareholders’ stake in the company. As stated earlier, the calculation of equity is a company's total assets minus its total liabilities. Shareholder equity can also be expressed as a company's share capital and retained earnings less the value of treasury shares. This method, however, is less common. Though both methods yield the same figure, the use of total assets and total liabilities is more illustrative of a company's financial health. By comparing concrete numbers reflecting everything the company owns and everything it owes, the "assets-minus-liabilities" shareholder equity equation paints a clear picture of a company's finances, which can be easily interpreted by investors and analysts. Shareholder equity can be either negative or positive. If positive, the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities. If negative, the company's liabilities exceed its assets; if prolonged, this is considered balance sheet insolvency.
