 Stock Splits and Share Consolidation . The number of shares outstanding will increase if a company undertakes a stock split, or will reduce if it undertakes a reverse stock split. Stock splits are usually undertaken to bring the share price of a company within the buying range of retail investors; the increase in the number of outstanding shares also improves liquidity. Conversely, a company will generally embark on a reverse split or share consolidation to bring its share price into the minimum range necessary to satisfy exchange listing requirements. While the lower number of outstanding shares may hamper liquidity, it could also deter short sellers since it will be more difficult to borrow shares for short sales. As an example, the online video streaming service Netflix, Inc. announcedÂ a seven-for-one stock split in 2015. In an attempt to increase the affordability of its stock and, concurrently, number of investors, Netflix increased its issuance of outstanding shares sevenfold, thus drastically reducing stock price.
