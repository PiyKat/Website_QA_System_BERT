 What Does the RoR Tell You? . A rate of return can be applied to any investment vehicle, from real estate to bonds, stocks, and fine art. RoR works with any asset provided the asset is purchased at one point in time and produces cash flow at some point in the future. Investments are assessed based, in part, on past rates of return, which can be compared against assets of the same type to determine which investments are the most attractive. Many investors like to pick a required rate of return before making a choice.
