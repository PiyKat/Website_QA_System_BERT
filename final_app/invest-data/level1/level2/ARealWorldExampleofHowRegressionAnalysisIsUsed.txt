 A Real World Example of How Regression Analysis Is Used . Regression is often used to determine how many specific factors such as the price of a commodity, interest rates, particular industries, or sectors influence the price movement of an asset. The aforementioned CAPM is based on regression, and it is utilized to project the expected returns for stocks and to generate costs of capital. A stock's returns are regressed against the returns of a broader index, such as the S&P 500, to generate a beta for the particular stock. Beta is the stock's risk in relation to the market or index and is reflected as the slope in the CAPM model. The expected return for the stock in question would be the dependent variable Y, while the independent variable X would be the market risk premium. Additional variables such as the market capitalization of a stock, valuation ratios, and recent returns can be added to the CAPM model to get better estimates for returns. These additional factors are known as the Fama-French factors, named after the professors who developed the multiple linear regression model to better explain asset returns.
