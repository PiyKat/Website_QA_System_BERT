 Credit Crunch Consequences . The usual consequence of a credit crunch is a prolonged recession, or slower recovery, which occurs as a result of the shrinking credit supply. In addition to tightening credit standards, lenders may increase interest rates during a credit crunch to earn greater revenues from the reduced number of customers who are able to borrow. Increased borrowing costs take away from an individual's ability to spend money in the economy, and it eats into business capital that could otherwise be used to grow operations and hire workers. For some businesses and consumers, the effects of a credit crunch are worse than an increase in the cost of capital. Businesses unable to borrow funds at all face trouble growing or expanding, and for some, remaining in business becomes a challenge. As businesses scale back operations and trim their workforce, productivity declines and unemployment rises, two leading indicators of a worsening recession.
