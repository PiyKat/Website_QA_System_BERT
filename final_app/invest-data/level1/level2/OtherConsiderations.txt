 Other Considerations . When the strike price and market price of the underlying security are equal, the option is called at the money (ATM). Options can also be out of the money meaning the strike price is not favorable to the market price. An OTM call option would have a higher strike price than the market price of the stock. Conversely, an OTM put option would have a lower strike price than the market price. An OTM option means that the option has yet to make money because the stock's price hasn't moved enough to make the option profitable. As a result, OTM options usually have lower premiums than ITM options. In short, the amount ofÂ premium paid for an option depends in large part of the extent an option is ITM, ATM, or OTM. However, many other factors can affect the premium of an option including how much the stock fluctuates, called volatility, and the time until the expiration. Higher volatility and a longer time until expiration mean a greater chance that the option could move ITM. As a result, the premium cost is higher.
