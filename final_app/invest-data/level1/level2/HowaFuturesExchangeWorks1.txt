 How a Futures Exchange Works . Another very important aspect of the exchange is that it provides clearing services. While various firms provide the clearing, the exchange standardizes the charges and the performance of that service. Clearing services insure that participants don't have to worry about the risk of their trade counterparty failing to deliver on their contractual obligations. That makes trading a very simple proposition for short-term speculators and keeps them interested in participating in the futures market.
