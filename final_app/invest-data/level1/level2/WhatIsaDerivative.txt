 What Is a Derivative? . A derivative is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assetsâ€”a benchmark. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties, and the derivative derives its price from fluctuations in the underlying asset. The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. These assets are commonly purchased through brokerages. (See how your broker compares with Investopedia list of the best online brokers). Derivatives can trade over-the-counter (OTC) or on an exchange. OTC derivatives constitute a greater proportion of the derivatives market. OTC-traded derivatives, generally have a greater possibility of counterparty risk. Counterparty risk is the danger that one of the parties involved in the transaction might default. These parties trade between two private parties and are unregulated. Conversely, derivatives that are exchange-traded are standardized and more heavily regulated.
