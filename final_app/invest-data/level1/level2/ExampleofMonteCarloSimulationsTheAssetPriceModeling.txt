 Example of Monte Carlo Simulations: The Asset Price Modeling . One way to employ a Monte Carlo simulation is to model possible movements of asset prices using Excel or a similar program. There are two components to an asset's price movements: drift, which is a constant directional movement, and a random input, which represents market volatility. By analyzing historical price data, you can determine the drift, standard deviation, variance, and average price movement for a security. These are the building blocks of a Monte Carlo simulation. To project one possible price trajectory, use the historical price data of the asset to generate a series of periodic daily returns using the natural logarithm (note that this equation differs from the usual percentage change formula): ﻿Periodic Daily Return=ln(Day’s PricePrevious Day’s Price)\begin{aligned} &\text{Periodic Daily Return} = ln \left ( \frac{ \text{Day's Price} }{ \text{Previous Day's Price} } \right ) \\ \end{aligned}​Periodic Daily Return=ln(Previous Day’s PriceDay’s Price​)​﻿ Next use the AVERAGE, STDEV.P, and VAR.P functions on the entire resulting series to obtain the average daily return, standard deviation, and variance inputs, respectively. The drift is equal to:
