 Example of Mental Accounting . Individuals don't realize the mental accounting line of thinking seems to make sense, but is in fact highly illogical. For instance, some people keep a special “money jar” or similar fund set aside for a vacation or a new home, while at the same time carrying substantial credit card debt. They are likely to treat the money in this special fund differently from the money that is being used to pay down debt, in spite of the fact that diverting funds from the debt repayment process increases interest payments, thereby reducing their total net worth. Broken down further, it’s illogical (and, in fact, detrimental) to maintain a savings jar that earns little or no interest while simultaneously holding credit-card debt that accrues double-digit figures annually. In many cases, the interest on this debt will erode any interest you could earn in a savings account. Individuals in this scenario would be best off using the funds they have saved in the special account to pay off the expensive debt before it accumulates any further. Put in this way, the solution to this problem seems straightforward. Nonetheless, many people do not behave in this way. The reason has to do with the type of personal value that individuals place on particular assets. Many people feel, for example, that money saved for a new house or a child’s college fund is simply “too important” to relinquish, even if doing so would be the most logical and beneficial move. So the practice of maintaining money in a low- or no-interest account while also carrying outstanding debt remains common.
