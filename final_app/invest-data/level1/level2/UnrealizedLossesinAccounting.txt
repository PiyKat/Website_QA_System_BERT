 Unrealized Losses in Accounting . While unrealized losses are theoretical, they may be subject to different types of treatment depending on the type of security. Securities that are held to maturity have no net effect on a firm's finances and are, therefore, not recorded in its financial statements. The firm may decide to include a footnote mentioning them in the statements. Trading securities, however, are recorded in a balance sheet or income statement at their fair value. This is primarily because their value can increase or decrease a firm's profits or losses. Thus, unrealized losses can have a direct impact on a firm's earnings per share. But their effect on a firm's cash flow is neutral. Securities that are available for sale are also recorded in a firm's financial statement at fair value as assets.
