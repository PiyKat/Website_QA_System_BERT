 Example of How to Use Average Return . One example of average return is the simple arithmetic mean. For example, suppose an investment returns the following annually over a period of five full years: 10%, 15%, 10%, 0%, and 5%. To calculate the average return for the investment over this five-year period, the five annual returns are added together and then divided by 5. This produces an annual average return of 8%. Or consider Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT). Shares of Wal-Mart returned 9.1% in 2014, lost 28.6% in 2015, gained 12.8% in 2016, gained 42.9% in 2017 and lost 5.7% in 2018. The average return of Wal-Mart over those five years is 6.1% or 30.5% divided by 5 years.
