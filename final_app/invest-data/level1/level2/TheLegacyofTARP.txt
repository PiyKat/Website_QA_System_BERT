 The Legacy of TARP . In December 2013, the Treasury wrapped up TARP and the government concluded that its investments had earned more than $11 billion for taxpayers. To be more specific, TARP recovered funds totaling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested. The government also claimed that TARP prevented the American auto industry from failing and saved more than 1 million jobs, helped stabilize banks, and restored credit availability for individuals and businesses. Even so, economists, politicians and financial professionals still debate TARP's merits and wonder if it had been necessary. Critics charge the program did little to help the housing markets, which remained depressed for years. Some say it didn't go far enough—that the government should have insisted on an equity stake in the financial firms it was bailing out, to help control their future practices. Instead, they say, TARP's no-strings loans essentially acted as a reward for bad behavior, sending a message of "Act irresponsibly and we'll help you out"—and establishing a dangerous precedent of dependency. TARP also did not endear the government to the American public, which saw Wall Street reap benefits—including those notorious bonuses—and return to profitability, even as individuals struggled with debt, unemployment, and foreclosures in the wake of the Great Recession.
