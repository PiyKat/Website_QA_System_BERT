This category includes people who feel they lack the necessary qualifications or education, who believe there is no work available in their field, or who feel they are too young or old to find work. Those who feel unable to find work due to discrimination also fall under this category. Note that the denominator—normally labor force—is adjusted to include discouraged workers, who are not technically part of the labor force. Unemployed people, plus those who are marginally attached to the labor force, as a percentage of the labor force (plus the marginally attached). ﻿U-5=Unemployed+Marginally AttachedLabor Force+Marginally Attached×100\begin{aligned} &\text{U-5} = \frac { \text{Unemployed} + \text{Marginally Attached} }{ \text{Labor Force} + \text{Marginally Attached} } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-5=Labor Force+Marginally AttachedUnemployed+Marginally Attached​×100​﻿ People who are marginally attached to the labor force include discouraged workers and anyone else who would like a job and has looked for one in the past 12 months but have given up actively searching. As with U-4, the denominator is expanded to include the marginally attached, who are not technically part of the labor force.
