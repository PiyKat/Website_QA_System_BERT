 Alternatives to Exercising a Put Option . The put seller, known as the "writer", does not need to hold an option until expiration, and neither does the option buyer. As the underlying stock price moves, the premium of the option will changeÂ to reflect the recent underlying price movements. The option buyer can sell their option at any time, either to cut their loss and recoup part of the premium (if OTM), or lock in a profit (if ITM). Similarly, the option writer can do the same thing. If the underlying's price is above the strike price they may do nothing because the option may expire worthless and they can keep the whole premium. But if the underlying's price is approaching or dropping below the strike price, to avoid a big loss the option writer may simply buy the option back, getting them out of the position. The profit or loss is the difference between the premium collected and premium paid to get out of the position.
