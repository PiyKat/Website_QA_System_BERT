 What is Economic Growth? . Economic growth is an increase in the the production of economic goods and services, compared from one period of time to another. It can be measured in nominal or real (adjusted for inflation) terms. Traditionally, aggregate economic growth is measured in terms of gross national product (GNP)Â or gross domestic product (GDP), although alternative metrics are sometimes used.
