 What Is Scenario Analysis? . Scenario analysis is the process of estimating the expected value of a portfolio after a given period of time, assuming specific changes in the values of the portfolio's securities or key factors take place, such as a change in the interest rate. Scenario analysis is commonly used to estimate changes to a portfolio's value in response to an unfavorable event and may be used to examine a theoretical worst-case scenario. [Important: Scenario analysis is only as good as the inputs and assumptions made by the analyst.]
