 How Cumulative Return Works . The cumulative return of a stock that does not have a dividend is easily calculated by figuring out the amount of profit or loss over the original price. For example, investing $10,000 in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for a 10-year period ending on Dec. 31, 2018, results in $48,922. With no dividends reinvested, this is a total cumulative return of 697.99% or an average of 10.94%; it also includes two stock splits. The value of dividends received during that time period also adds another $13,611 in profit above the original investment. Calculating the cumulative return for a stock that reinvests dividends is much more difficult. In the Johnson & Johnson example above, reinvesting the dividends nets a total value of $75,626. Cumulative return could be misleading in this scenario because the reinvested aggregate amount is more than the previous example, where the total between the principal of $48,922 and dividends not invested of $13,611 is $62,533. Reinvesting the dividends increases the investor’s cost basis and reduces cumulative return. For the reinvested example, the stockholder’s cumulative return is 656.26% or an average of 10.64%. When compared, the reinvested amount has a lower cumulative return but really yields more total dollar amount for the investor, with an additional $13,093.
