 Real World Example of Liquidity . In terms of investments, equities as a class are among the most liquid assets. But not all equities are created equal when it comes to liquidity. Some shares trade more actively than others on stock exchanges, meaning there is more of a market for them—they attract greater, more consistent interest from traders and investors, in other words. These liquid stocks are usually identifiable by their daily volume, which can number millions of shares, or even hundreds of millions. For example, on April 26, 2019, 8.2 million shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) traded on the Nasdaq. Liquid as that sounds, it's not a drop in the bucket compared to Intel (INTC), which led the Nasdaq that day, with a volume of 71.5 million shares—or to Ford Motor (F), which led the New York Stock Exchange with a volume of 154.8 million shares, making it the most liquid stock in the U.S. that day.
