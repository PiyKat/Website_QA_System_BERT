 Delta Neutral Explained . A delta-neutral portfolio evens out the response to market movements for a certain range to bring the net change of the position to zero. Delta measures how much an option's price changes when the underlying security's price changes. As the value of the underlying assets changes, the position of the Greeks will shift between being positive, negative and neutral. Investors who want to maintain delta neutrality must adjust their portfolio holdings accordingly. Options traders use delta neutral strategies to profit either from implied volatility or from time decay of the options. Delta neutral strategies are also used for hedging purposes.
