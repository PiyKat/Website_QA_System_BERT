 What is Market Value Of Equity? . Market value of equity is the total dollar value of a company's equity and is also known as market capitalization. This measure of a company's value is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. A company's market value of equity is therefore always changing as these two input variables change. It is used to measure a company's size and helps investors diversify their investments across companies of different sizes and different levels of risk. Investors looking to calculate market value of equity can find the total number of shares outstanding by looking to the equity section of a company's balance sheet.
