 What Is a Futures Exchange? . A futures exchange is a diverse marketplace where commodities futures, index futures, and options on futures contracts are bought and sold. Those who are allowed access to the exchange are brokers and commercial traders who are members of the exchange. Members need to be registered with the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Individuals who want to trade futures contracts must do so by having an account with a registered broker. Futures exchanges also provide clearing and settlement functions.
