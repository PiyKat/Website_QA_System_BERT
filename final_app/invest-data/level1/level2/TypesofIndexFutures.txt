 Types of Index Futures . Some of the most popular index futures are based on equities. However, each product may use a different multiple for determining the price of the futures contract. As an example, the value of the S&P 500 futures contract is $250 times the S&P 500 index value. The E-mini S&P 500 futures contract has a value of 50 times the value of the index. Index futures are also available for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq 100 along with E-mini Dow (YM) and E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ) contracts. Index futures are available for foreign markets including the German, Frankfurt Exchange traded (DAX)—which is similar to the Dow Jones—the SMI index in Europe, and the Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong.
