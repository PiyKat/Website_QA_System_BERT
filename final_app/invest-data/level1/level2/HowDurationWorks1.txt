 How Duration Works . The second type of duration is called "modified duration" and, unlike Macaulay duration, is not measured in years. Modified duration measures the expected change in a bond's price to a 1% change in interest rates. In order to understand modified duration, keep in mind that bond prices are said to have an inverse relationship with interest rates. Therefore, rising interest rates indicateÂ that bond prices are likely to fall, while declining interest rates indicate that bond prices are likely to rise.
