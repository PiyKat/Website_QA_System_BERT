 How Limited Risk Works: An Example . An investor might create an investment portfolio with X shares of Company Beta, which manufactures couches. The furniture industry is cyclical, so Company Beta will likely sell more couches during times of economic growth than it will during times when the economy is slow or contracting. Because of this, Company Beta’s shares will decline in value during slow economic times. As an investor, you might want to protect your portfolio from this volatility, or limit your risk. One way is to buy stocks that are not as sensitive to economic cycles. Sometimes called defensive stocks, they include food, utilities or other industries that sell products that consumers consider necessary. Theoretically, these stocks hold their value during economic downturns. The defensive stocks act as a bulwark, limiting the risk of holding shares of Company Beta. Another way to limit the risk of an investment is to purchase a put option contract on the shares. Though costly, this would allow an investor to lock in a minimum price at which the shares could always be sold. An investor could also sell a futures contract, promising to sell the stock at a set price at a certain point in the future.
