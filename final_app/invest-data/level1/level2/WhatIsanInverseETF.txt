 What Is an Inverse ETF? . An inverse ETF is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) constructed by using various derivatives to profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark. Investing in inverse ETFs is similar to holding various short positions, which involve borrowing securities and selling them with the hope of repurchasing them at a lower price. An inverse ETFÂ is also known as a "Short ETF," or "Bear ETF."
