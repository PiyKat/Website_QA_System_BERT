 Real World Example of a Margin Call . Amount to Meet Minimum Maintenance Margin = (Market Value of Securities x Maintenance Margin) - Investor's Equity So, the investor needs at least $15,000 of equity (the market value of securities of $60,000 times the 25% maintenance margin) in his account to be eligible for margin. But he only has $10,000 in investor's equity, resulting in a $5,000 deficiency ($60,000 x 25%) - $10,000.
