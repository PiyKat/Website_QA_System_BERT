 Understanding Subprime Mortgages . "Subprime" doesn't refer to the interest rates often attached to these mortgages, but rather the credit score of the individual taking out the mortgage. Borrowers with FICO credit scores below 600 will often be stuck with subprime mortgages and their corresponding higher interest rates. It can be useful for people with low credit scores to wait for a period of time and build up their credit histories before applying for a mortgage so they might qualify for a prime loan. The interest rate associated with a subprime mortgage is dependent on four factors: credit score, the size of the down payment, the number of late payment delinquencies on a borrower's credit report, and the types of the delinquencies found on the report.
