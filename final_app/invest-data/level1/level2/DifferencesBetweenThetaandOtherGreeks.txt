 Differences Between Theta and Other Greeks . The Greeks measure the sensitivity of options prices to their respective variables. The delta of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's price in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security. The gamma of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's delta in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security. Vega indicates how an option's price theoretically changes for each one percentage point move in implied volatility.
