 Cumulative Return Versus Compound Return . Along with the cumulative return, a mutual fund or other investment usually indicates its compound return. Unlike the cumulative return, the compound return figure is annualized. While cumulative returns may sound more impressive than the usually smaller annualized rate of return, they typically omit the effect of the annual expenses on the returns an investor will truly receive. Annual expenses an investor may expect include fund total expense ratios, interest rates on loans and management fees. When worked out on a cumulative basis, these fees can substantially eat into cumulative return numbers.
