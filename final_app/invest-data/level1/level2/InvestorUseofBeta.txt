 Investor Use of Beta . One way for a stock investor to think about risk is to split it into two categories. The first category is called systematic risk, which is the risk of the entire market declining. The financial crisis in 2008 is an example of a systematic-risk event when no amount of diversification could prevent investors from losing value in their stock portfolios. systematic risk is also known as un-diversifiable risk. Unsystematic or diversifiable risks are associated with an individual stock. The surprise announcement that Lumber Liquidators (LL) had been selling hardwood flooring with dangerous levels of formaldehyde in 2015 is an example of an unsystematic risk that was specific to that company. Unsystematic risk can be partially mitigated through diversification.
