 Cash Settlement of S&P 500 Futures . Industry experts created the cash settlement mechanism to resolve the massive logistical challenges presented by delivering the actual 500 stocks associated with an S&P 500 futures contract. Not only would the stocks have to be negotiated and transferred between holders, but they would have to be properly weighted to match their representation in the Index. Instead, an investor picks a long or short position, which is then subject to a mark-to-market. The investor pays any losses or receives profits each day in cash. Eventually, the contract expires, or is offset, and becomes cash-settled based on the spot value of the S&P 500 index.
