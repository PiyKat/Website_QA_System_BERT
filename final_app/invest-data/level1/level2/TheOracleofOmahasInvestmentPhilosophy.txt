 The Oracle of Omaha’s Investment Philosophy . Warren Buffet is a value investor; he looks to purchase companies that are below their intrinsic worth but have the potential to make money. Buffet attempts to do this by buying companies that are out of favor with the market. He values a company by assessing its fundamentals, such as return on equity and profitability. For example, Buffett likes a company to have a low debt/equity ratio; he wants earnings growth generated from shareholder’s equity as opposed to debt. The Oracle of Omaha’s quote “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” sums up his investment philosophy.
