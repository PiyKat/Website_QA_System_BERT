 Example of Monte Carlo Simulations: The Asset Price Modeling . ﻿Next Day’s Price=Today’s Price×e(Drift+Random Value)\begin{aligned} &\text{Next Day's Price} = \text{Today's Price} \times e^{ ( \text{Drift} + \text{Random Value} ) }\\ \end{aligned}​Next Day’s Price=Today’s Price×e(Drift+Random Value)​﻿ To take e to a given power x in Excel, use the EXP function: EXP(x). Repeat this calculation the desired number of times (each repetition represents one day) to obtain a simulation of future price movement. By generating an arbitrary number of simulations, you can assess the probability that a security's price will follow given trajectory. Here is an example, showing around 30 projections for the Time Warner Inc's (TWX) stock for the remainder of November 2015: The frequencies of different outcomes generated by this simulation will form a normal distribution, that is, a bell curve. The most likely return is at the middle of the curve, meaning there is an equal chance that the actual return will be higher or lower than that value. The probability that the actual return will be within one standard deviation of the most probable ("expected") rate is 68%; that it will be within two standard deviations is 95%; and that it will be within three standard deviations is 99.7%. Still, there is no guarantee that the most expected outcome will occur, or that actual movements will not exceed the wildest projections. Crucially, Monte Carlo simulations ignore everything that is not built into the price movement (macro trends, company leadership, hype, cyclical factors); in other words, they assume perfectly efficient markets. For example, the fact that Time Warner lowered its guidance for the year on November 4 is not reflected here, except in the price movement for that day, the last value in the data; if that fact were accounted for, the bulk of simulations would probably not predict a modest rise in price.
