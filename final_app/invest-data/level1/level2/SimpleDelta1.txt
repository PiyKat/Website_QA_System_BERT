 Simple Delta . Figure 2 contains some hypothetical values for S&P 500 call options that are at, out and in the money (in all these cases, we will be using long options). Call delta values range from 0 to 1.0, while put delta values range from 0 to –1.0. As you can see, the at-the-money call option (strike price at 900) in figure 2 has a 0.5 delta, while the out-of-the-money (strike price at 950) call option has a 0.25 delta, and the in-the-money (strike at 850) has a delta value of 0.75.  [Delta is just one of the major risk measures skilled options traders analyze and make use of in their trading strategies.

If these were puts, the same values would have a negative sign attached to them. This reflects the fact that put options increase in value when the underlying asset price falls. (An inverse relationship is indicated by the negative delta sign.) You will see below, when we look at short option positions and the concept of position delta, that the story gets a bit more complicated.
