 Exchange Traded Funds . The first ETFs began trading in the 1990s. Regulations primarily required these funds to be passively managed with securities tracking an index. In 2008, regulatory changes began to make actively managed ETFs available for U.S. investors. Historically, ETFs have been popular for index investors seeking to gain exposure to a particular market segment with the benefits of having diversification across the sector. Following the 2008 market crisis, the popularity of smart beta funds began to increase. Within the ETF offering arena, smart beta provides a type of customized index product built around a factor-based index methodology. This customization lets investors choose from index options with selected fundamental characteristics which, in many cases, can substantially outperform. With the evolution of smart beta index funds, ETF options have widened, giving investors a broader variety of passive ETF choices. Fees are also an important consideration for ETF investors. ETFs do not carry sales load fees. Investors will pay a commission if required for trading them, but many ETFs trade for free. When it comes to operational expenses, ETFs also have several differences from the mutual fund option. ETF expenses are usually lower for a few reasons. ETFs have lower management fees because many of them are passive funds which do not require stock analysis from the fund manager. Transaction fees are also typically lower as less trading is needed. As mentioned, ETFs also do not charge 12b-1 fees which decreases the overall expense ratio. The pricing of ETFs also differs from mutual fund pricing. An important consideration when comparing the two. ETFs trade throughout the day on exchanges like a stock. This active trading can appeal to many investors who prefer real-time trading and transaction activity in their portfolio. Overall, the price of an ETF reflects the real-time pricing of the securities held within the portfolio.
