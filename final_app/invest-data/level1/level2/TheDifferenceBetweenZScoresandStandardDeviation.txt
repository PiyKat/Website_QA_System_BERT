 The Difference Between Z-Scores and Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is essentially a reflection of the amount of variability within a given data set. To calculate the standard deviation, first, calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. The differences are then squared, summed and averaged to produce the variance. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, which brings it back to the original unit of measure. The Z-score, by contrast, is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. To calculate Z-score, simply subtract the mean from each data point and divide the result by the standard deviation. For data points that are below the mean, the Z-score is negative. In most large data sets, 99% of values have a Z-score between -3 and 3, meaning they lie within three standard deviations above and below the mean.
