 Understanding Implied Volatility . Implied volatility is the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. It is a metric used by investors to estimate future fluctuations (volatility) of a security's price based on certain predictive factors. Implied volatility, denoted by the symbol σ (sigma), can often be thought to be a proxy of market risk. It is commonly expressed using percentages and standard deviations over a specified time horizon. When applied to the stock market, implied volatility generally increases in bearish markets, when investors believe equity prices will decline over time. IV decreases when the market is bullish, and investors believe that prices will rise over time. Bearish markets are considered to be undesirable, hence riskier, to the majority of equity investors. Implied volatility does not predict the direction in which the price change will proceed. For example, high volatility means a large price swing, but the price could swing upward—very high—downward—very low—or fluctuate between the two directions. Low volatility means that the price likely won't make broad, unpredictable changes.
