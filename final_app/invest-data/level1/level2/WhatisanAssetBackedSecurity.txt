 What is an Asset-Backed Security? . An asset-backed security (ABS) is a financial security such as a bond or note which is collateralized by a pool of assets such as loans, leases, credit card debt, royalties, or receivables. For investors, asset-backed securities are an alternative to investing in corporate debt. An ABS is similar to a mortgage-backed security, except that the underlying securities are not mortgage-based.
