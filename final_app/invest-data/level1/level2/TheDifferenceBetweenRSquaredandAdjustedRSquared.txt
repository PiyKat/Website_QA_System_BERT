 The Difference Between R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared . R-Squared only works as intended in a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable. With a multiple regression made up of several independent variables, the R-Squared must be adjusted. The adjusted R-squared compares the descriptive power of regression models that include diverse numbers of predictors. Every predictor added to a model increases R-squared and never decreases it. Thus, a model with more terms may seem to have a better fit just for the fact that it has more terms, while the adjusted R-squared compensates for the addition of variables and only increases if the new term enhances the model above what would be obtained by probability and decreases when a predictor enhances the model less than what is predicted by chance. In an overfitting condition, an incorrectly high value of R-squared, which leads to a decreased ability to predict, is obtained. This is not the case with the adjusted R-squared. While standard R-squared can be used to compare the goodness of two or model different models, adjusted R-squared is not a good metric for comparing nonlinear models or multiple linear regressions.
