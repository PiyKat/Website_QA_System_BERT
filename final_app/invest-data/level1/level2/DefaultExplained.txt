 Default Explained . A default can occur on secured debt such as a mortgage loan secured by a house or a business loan secured by a company's assets. If an individual borrower fails to make timely mortgage payments, the loan could go into default. Similarly, if a business issues bonds—essentially borrowing from investors—and it's unable to make coupon payments to its bondholders, the business is in default on its bonds. A default has adverse effects on the borrower's credit and ability to borrow in the future.
