 Example of Hedging . Hedging is the act of taking a position in a related and uncorrelated security, which helps to mitigate against opposite price movements. For example, assume an investor bought 1,000 shares of Tesla Motors (TSLA) for $65 a share. The investment is held for over two years and now the investor is worried that Tesla will miss earnings per share (EPS) and revenue expectations—sending shares lower and giving back some of the profits accumulated over those two years. Tesla's stock price is now $244—representing a value of $244,000 and an unrealized profit of $179,000 on 1,000 shares—and the investor wants to initiate a protective strategy. To hedge the position against the risk of any adverse price fluctuations, the investor buys 10 put option contracts on Tesla with a strike price of $230 and a September expiration date.
