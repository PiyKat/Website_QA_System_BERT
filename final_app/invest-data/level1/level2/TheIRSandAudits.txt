 The IRS and Audits . As part of its enforcement mission, the IRS audits a select portion of income tax returns every year. For the 2017 tax year, the agency audited approximately 1.2 million income tax returns or 0.6% of all returns filed. This number breaks down to 0.7% of individual income tax returns and 1.1% of corporate tax returns (excluding S corporations). Around 71% of IRS audits occurred through the mail, while 29% happened in the field.  After rising to a peak in 2010, the number of audits has steadily dropped each year. The amount of funding set aside for tax enforcement has declined 20% from 2010 to 2016, which indicates even fewer audits should occur. Reasons for an IRS audit vary, but some factors may increase the odds of an examination. Chief among them: higher income. In 2017, the overall audit rate was one in 167 tax returns, but for someone who made more than $1 million income, the odds were 1 in 23 returns. And running your own business carries greater risks too. Individuals making between $200,000 and $1 million in one tax year who don't file Schedule C (the form for the self-employed) have a .8% chance of being audited, vs. 1.6.%—basically double—for those who do. Other red flags for an audit include failing to declare the right amount of income, claiming a higher-than-normal amount of deductions (especially business-related ones), making disproportionately large charitable donations compared to income and claiming rental real estate losses. No single factor determines who does or does not face an IRS audit each year.
