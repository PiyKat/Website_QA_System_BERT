 Understanding the Income Statement . The income statement is an important part of a company’s performance reports that must be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While a balance sheet provides the snapshot of a company’s financials as of a particular date, the income statement reports income through a particular time period and its heading indicates the duration, which may read as “For the (fiscal) year/quarter ended September 30, 2018.” (See also, What is the difference between an income statement and a balance sheet?) The income statement focuses on the four key items - revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. It does not cover receipts (money received by the business) or the cash payments/disbursements (money paid by the business). It starts with the details of sales, and then works down to compute the net income and eventually the earnings per share (EPS). Essentially, it gives an account of how the net revenue realized by the company gets transformed into net earnings (profit or loss).
