 Basics of Dollar Duration . Dollar duration is based on a linear approximation of how a bond's value will change in response to changes in interest rates. The actual relationship between a bond's value and interest rates is not linear. Therefore, dollar duration is an imperfect measure of interest rate sensitivity, and it will only provide an accurate calculation for small changes in interest rates. Mathematically, the dollar duration measures the change in the value of a bond portfolio for every 100 basis point change in interest rates. Dollar duration is often referred to as DV01 (dollar value per 01). Remember 0.01 being 1 percent which is 100 basis points. To calculate the dollar duration of a bond you need to know its duration, the current interest rate and the change in interest rates.              Dollar Duration = DUR x (∆ i/1+ i) x P While dollar duration refers to an individual bond price, the sum of the weighted bond dollar durations in a portfolio is the portfolio dollar duration. Dollar duration can be applied to other fixed income products such as forwards, par rates, zero coupon bonds and many more.
