 Speculation on Index Futures . Speculation is an advanced trading strategy that is not suited for many investors. However, experienced traders will use index futures to speculate on the direction of an index. Instead of buying individual stocks or assets, a trader can bet on the direction of a group of assets by buying or selling index futures. For example, to replicate the S&P 500 index, investors would need to buy all 500 stocks in the index. Instead, index futures can be used to bet on the direction of all 500 stocks with one contract creating the same effect of owning all 500 stocks in the S&P. Portfolio managers use index futures to hedge declines in similar holdings. Brokerage accounts required only a fraction of the contract's value held as a margin, Index futures allows for speculation on the index price movement.
