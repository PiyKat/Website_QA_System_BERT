 A Closer Look at Drawdowns . A retirement account commonly has a "drawdown percentage" that represents the part of the total account balance that retiree has assumed each year. A drawdown usually causes a peak-to-trough decline period for an investment, trading account, or fund, and it is often quoted as the percentage between the peak and the trough that follows. For example, if a trading account has $1,000 in it, and the funds drop to $900 before rising back to $1,000 or higher, the trading account is said to have seen a 10% drawdown. A drawdown loan is sometimes known as a "drawdown facility," and this makes it easier for the borrower to take out additional credit—as is often the case with flexible mortgage accounts. In this sense, a drawdown is the extent of an asset's price decline between its peak and trough. For example, if the price of oil were to decline from $100 to $75 per barrel, its drawdown would be 25%. When we look at the uptick in share price needed to offset a drawdown, drawdowns can actually be risky for investors. For example, a 1% stock loss only needs a 1.01% rise to recover to its previous peak, but a drawdown of 20% needs a 25% return to reach the old peak. During the 2008–2009 Great Recession, 50% drawdowns became common; these had to see massive 100% increases to recover the former peaks.
