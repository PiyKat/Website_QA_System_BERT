 Understanding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . The CFTC has five committees, each headed by a commissioner who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. These five committees focus on agriculture, global markets, energy and environmental markets, technology, and cooperation between the CFTC and SEC. The committees are populated by individuals who represent the interests of specific industries, traders, futures exchanges, commodities exchanges, consumers and the environment. The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936 and amended several times since, the CEA establishes the statutory framework under which the CFTC operates. Under this Act, the CFTC has authority to establish regulations that are published in Title 17, Chapter I, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
