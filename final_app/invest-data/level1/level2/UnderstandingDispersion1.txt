 Understanding Dispersion . Alpha is a statistic that measures a portfolio's risk-adjusted returns, that is, how much more or less did the investment return relative to the index or beta. A return higher than the beta indicates a positive alpha, usually attributed to the success of the portfolio manager or model. A negative alpha indicates the lack of success of the portfolio manager in beating the beta, or more broadly, the market.
