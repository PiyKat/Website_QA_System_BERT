 Example—How Does a Put Option Work? . An investor purchases one put option contract on ABC company for $100. Each option contract covers 100 shares. The exercise price of the shares is $10, and the current ABC share price is $12. This put option contract has given the investor the right, but not the obligation, to sell 100 shares of ABC at $10. If ABC shares drop to $8, the investor's put option is in the money (ITM)—which means that the strike price is below the market price of the underlying asset—and she can close her option position by selling the contract on the open market. On the other hand, she can purchase 100 shares of ABC at the existing market price of $8, and then exercise her contract to sell the shares for $10. Disregarding commissions, the profit for this position is $200, or 100 x ($10 - $8). Remember that the investor paid a $100 premium for the put option, giving her the right to sell her shares at the exercise price. Factoring in this initial cost, her total profit is $200 - $100 = $100. As another way of working a put option as a hedge, if the investor in the previous example already owns 100 shares of ABC company, that position would be called a married put and could serve as a hedge against a decline in the share price.
