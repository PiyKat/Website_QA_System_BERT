 Fiduciary Insurance . A business can insure the individuals who act as fiduciaries of a qualified retirement plan, such as the company's directors, officers, employees, and other natural person trustees. Fiduciary liability insurance is meant to fill in the gaps existing in traditional coverage offered through employee benefits liability or director's and officer's policies. It provides financial protection when the need for litigation arisesâ€”due to scenarios such as purported mismanaging funds or investments, administrative errors or delays in transfers or distributions, a change or reduction in benefits, or erroneous advice surrounding investment allocation within the plan.
