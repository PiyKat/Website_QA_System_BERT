 Bear Market vs. Correction . A bear market should not be confused with a correction, which is a short-term trend that has a duration of fewer than two months. While corrections offer a good time for value investors to find an entry point into stock markets, bear markets rarely provide suitable points of entry. This barrier is because it is almost impossible to determine a bear market's bottom. Trying to recoup losses can be an uphill battle unless investors are short sellers or use other strategies to make gains in falling markets. Between 1900 and 2018, there were 33 bear markets, averaging one every 3.5 years. One of the most recent bear markets coincided with the global financial crisis occurring between October 2007 and March 2009. During that time the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 54%. As of December 2018, some forecasters predict that we are headed toward another bear market.
