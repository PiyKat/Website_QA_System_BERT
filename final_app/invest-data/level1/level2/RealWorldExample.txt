 Real World Example . Let's say a retailer had a crucial warehouse that held the majority of its offerings. The retailer knows that it needs to be fully-stocked ahead of a critical holiday shopping season and is depending on the contents of this warehouse to satisfy its customers and help it capitalize on consumer spending. If anything happens to this warehouse, it would be a huge blow to the retailer. Not only would the retailer have lost inventory it already paid for, but it would experience a business interruption resulting from the destruction of its inventory, its inability to fulfill customer orders, and its inability to take advantage of the holiday shopping period. The maximum foreseeable loss in this scenario is that a fire or natural disaster destroys the warehouse ahead shopping event. The destruction of the warehouse would cause a massive business interruption that would substantially damage the company's results, not to mention hurt its reputation with consumers in the long run. As a result, purchasing insurance in anticipation of the maximum foreseeable loss would be essential for the retailer.
