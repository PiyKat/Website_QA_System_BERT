 American Options Explained . American options outline the timeframe when the option holder can exercise their option contract rights. These rights allow the holder to buy or sell—depending on if the option is a call or put—the underlying asset, at the set strike price on or before the predetermined expiration date. Since investors have the freedom to exercise their options at any point during the life of the contract, American style options are more valuable than the limited European options. However, the ability to exercise early carries an added premium or cost. The last day to exercise a weekly American option is normally on the Friday of the week in which the option contract expires. Conversely, the last day to exercise a monthly American option is normally the third Friday of the month. The majority of exchange-traded options on single stocks are American, while options on indexes tend to be European style.
