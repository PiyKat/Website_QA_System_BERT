 Diversification and Acquisition of Holdings . The proportion of holdings within a portfolio has a significant impact on its overall return. The performance of the largest holdings has a bigger influence on portfolio return than small or marginal holdings in the portfolio. Investors routinely scour the lists of the holdings of top money managers to piggyback on their trades. These investors usually seek to replicate the trading activity of the best money managers by buying stocks where the manager has initiated a long position or added significantly to an existing position and selling positions where the manager has exited a stake. This strategy may not always be successful for the average investor, given the considerable lag between the period when the money manager or fund affected the trades and the time when the fund's holdings are disseminated to the general public.
