 How a Private Investment in Public Equity Works . A publicly traded company may utilize a PIPE when securing funds for working capital, expansion, or acquisitions. The company may create new stock shares or use some from its supply, but the equities never go on sale on a stock exchange. Instead, these large investors purchase the company's stock in a private placement, and the issuer files a resale registration statement with the SEC. The issuing business typically obtains its funding—that is, the investors' money for the shares—within two to three weeks, rather than waiting several months or longer, as it would with a secondary stock offering. Registration of the new shares with the SEC typically becomes effective within a month of filing.
