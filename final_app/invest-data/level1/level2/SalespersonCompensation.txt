 Salesperson Compensation . Salesperson compensation represents another area often rife with moral hazard. When a business owner pays a salesperson a set salary not based on performance or sales numbers, the salesperson has an incentive to put forth less effort, take longer breaks, and generally have less motivation to be a sales superstar than if the compensation is tied to performance. In this scenario, the salesperson is acting in bad faith by not doing the job they were hired to do to the best of their ability. However, the salesperson knows the consequences of this decision, lower revenues, are shouldered by the boss, the business owner, while the salesperson's compensation remains the same. For this reason, most companies prefer to pay only a small base salary to salespeople, with the majority of their compensation coming from commissions and bonuses tied to sales performance. This compensation style provides salespeople with incentives to work hard because they bear the burden of slacking in the form of lower paychecks. (For related reading, see "What Is Moral Hazard?")
