 What Does the Expense Ratio Tell You? . Operating expenses vary according to the fund or stock; however, the expenses within the fund remain relatively stable.Â For example, a fund with low expenses will generally continue to have low expenses. The largest component of operating expenses is the fee paid to a fund's investment manager or advisor. Other costs include recordkeeping, custodial services, taxes, legal expenses, and accounting and auditing fees. Expenses that are charged by the fund are reflected in the fund's daily net asset value (NAV) and do not appear as a distinct charge to shareholders. Expense ratios can be modified in several ways.
