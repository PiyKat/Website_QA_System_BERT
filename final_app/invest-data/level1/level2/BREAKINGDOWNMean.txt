 BREAKING DOWN Mean . The mean is a statistical indicator that can be used to gauge the performance of: a company’s stock price over a period of days, months, or years; a company through its earnings over a number of years; a firm by assessing its fundamentals such as P/E ratio, FCF, liabilities on the balance sheet, etc.; and a portfolio by estimating its average returns over a certain period. An analyst who wants to measure the trajectory of a company’s stock value in the last, say 10 days, would sum up the closing price of the stock in each of the 10 days. The sum total would then be divided by the number of days to get the arithmetic mean. The geometric mean will be calculated by multiplying all the values together. The nth root of product total is then taken, in this case the 10th root, to get the mean.
