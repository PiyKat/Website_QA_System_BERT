 An Example of the Effect of Subprime Mortgages . The 2008 housing market crash was due in large part to widespread defaults on subprime mortgages. Many borrowers were given what were known as NINJA loans (No Income No Job No Assets). These mortgages were often issued with no down payment required, and proof of income was not necessary, either. A buyer might state that she earned $150,000 a year but did not have to provide documentation to substantiate her claim. These borrowers then found themselves underwater in a declining housing market with their home values lower than the mortgage they owed. Many of these NINJA borrowers defaulted because the interest rates associated with the loans were "teaser rates," variable rates that started low and ballooned over time, making it very hard to pay down the principle of the mortgage. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and other financial institutions reported in June 2015 that they would begin offering mortgages to individuals with credit ratings in the low 600s, and the non-profit, community advocacy and homeownership organization Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America launched an initiative in late 2018, hosting events nationwide to help people apply for "non-prime" loans, which are effectively the same as subprime mortgages.
