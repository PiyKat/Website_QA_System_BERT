 Understanding At The Money . At the money is one of three terms used to describe the relationship between an option's strike price and the underlying security's price, also called the option's moneyness. Options can be in the money (ITM), out of the money (OTM), or at the money. ITM means the option has intrinsic value. OTM means the option has no intrinsic value. Simply put, at the money options are not in a position to profit if exercised, but they still have value in that there is still time before they expire so they may yet end up in the money. The intrinsic value for a call option is calculated by subtracting the strike price from the underlying security's current price. The intrinsic value for a put option is calculated by subtracting the underlying asset's current price from its strike price. A call option is in the money when the option's strike price is less than the underlying security's current price. Conversely, a put option is in the money when the option's strike price is greater than the underlying security's stock price. A call option is out of the money when its strike price is greater than the current underlying security's price. A put option is out of the money when its strike price is less than the underlying asset's current price.
