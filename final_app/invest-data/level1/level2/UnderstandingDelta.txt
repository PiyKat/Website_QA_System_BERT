 Understanding Delta . Delta values can be positive or negative depending on the type of option. For example, the delta for a call option always ranges from 0 to 1 because as the underlying asset increases in price, call options increase in price. Put option deltas always range from -1 to 0 because as the underlying security increases, the value of put options decrease. For example, if a put option has a delta of -0.33 and the price of the underlying asset increases by $1, the price of the put option will decrease by $0.33. Technically, the value of the option's delta is the first derivative of the value of the option with respect to the underlying security's price. Delta is often used in hedgingÂ strategies and is also referred to as a hedge ratio.
