 Example of a Commodity ETF . Commodity ETFs track a wide range of underlying commodities, some of which include precious metals, oil, and natural gas. Further, other commodity ETFs instead track a diversified basket of commodities. Investors should always do their own research, but some of the best commodity ETFs are precious metals like gold and silver. These are popular ETFs because the underlying commodity can't go bad or spoil.Â  The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV) are two of the largest gold and silver ETFs. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF has an expense ratio of 0.4%, and the iShares Silver Trust has an expense ratio of 0.5%. Another popular type of commodity ETF is oil and natural gas. However, since oil and gas can't be stockpiled like precious metals, these ETFs invest in futures contracts instead of the commodity itself. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production ETF has a diversified portfolio of 60 oil- and gas-producing companies and has an annual expense ratio of 0.35%. Some investors like to increase diversification through diversified commodities ETFs. These ETFs, such as the iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers ETF, tracks the United States Commodity Index.
