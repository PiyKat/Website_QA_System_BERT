 Insurable Interest . It is your legal right to insure any type of property or any event that may cause financial loss or create legal liability for you. This is called insurable interest. Suppose you are living in your uncle's house, and you apply for homeowners' insurance because you believe that you may inherit the house later. Insurers will decline your offer because you are not the owner of the house and, therefore, you do not stand to suffer financially in the event of a loss. When it comes to insurance, it is not the house, car or machinery that is insured. Rather, it is the monetary interest in that house, car or machinery to which your policy applies. It is also the principle of insurable interest that allows married couples to take out insurance policies on each other's lives, on the principle that one may suffer financially if the spouse dies. Insurable interest also exists in some business arrangements, as seen between a creditor and debtor, between business partners or between employers and employees.
