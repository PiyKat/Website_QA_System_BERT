 Vanguard 500 Index Fund . The first index fund for individual investors, according to the company, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) provides exposure to a subset of the entire U.S. equity market—specifically, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, whose component companies account for about three-fourths of the U.S. stock market’s value. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund seeks to replicate its benchmark index by investing its total net assets in the stocks comprising the index and holding each component with approximately the same weight as the index. In this way, the fund barely deviates from the S&P, which it is designed to mimic.  The fund was issued on Aug. 31, 1976; as of April 30, 2019, it has generated an average annual return of 11.07%. The fund's Admiral Shares—the only ones currently available to new investors—have returned 6.37% annually since their inception on Nov. 13, 2000, only slightly less than the S&P 500. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has $479.7 billion in total net assets and, despite its name, holds 508 stocks. Like its sister fund, VFIAX charges an expense ratio of 0.04% and requires a minimum investment of $3,000.
