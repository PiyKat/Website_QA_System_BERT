 Real World Example of ITM Options . Let's say an investor holds a call option on Bank of America (BAC) stock with a strike price of $30. The shares currently trade at $33 making the contract in the money. The call option allows the investor to buy the stock for $30, and they could immediately sell the stock for $33, giving them a $3 per share difference. Each options contract represents 100 shares, so the intrinsic value is $3 x 100 = $300. If the investor paid a premium of $3.50 for the call, they would not profit from the trade. He would have paid $350 ($3.50 x 100 = $350) while only gaining $300 on the difference between the strike price and market price. In other words, he'd lose $50 on the trade. However, the option is still considered ITM because, at expiry, the option will have a value of $3 even though John's not earning a profit. Also, if the stock price fell from $33 to $29, the $30 strike price call is no longer ITM. It would be $1 OTM. It's important to note that while the strike price is fixed, the price of the underlying asset will fluctuate affecting the extent to which the option is in the money. An ITM option can move to ATM or even OTM before its expiration date.
