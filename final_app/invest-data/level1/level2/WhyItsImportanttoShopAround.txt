 Why It’s Important to Shop Around . Before the internet, your CD choices were essentially limited to what you could find in your community. But with the explosion of online rate shopping, plus the proliferation of internet banks—and traditional banks opening online portals—the number of CDs one can consider is astounding. It’s now possible to shop for CDs from about 150 banks that accept customers nationwide and allow for opening an account online or through the mail. In addition to that, you’ll have access to a number of regional and state banks, as well as credit unions, that will do business with you based on your residency in their state. As we’ve mentioned, though, the range of CD rates across these different institutions can vary widely. It’s a mistake to just open a CD at the bank where you already have a checking relationship without investigating how its rates compare with those you can earn elsewhere. Fortunately, our weekly rate research will put the very best nationally available rates in front of you for every term, making it easy to maximize your earnings. You should still shop for options within your state or community, but with our lists of the top nationally available rates, you’ll be able to easily determine which rates are worth your consideration and which are not.
