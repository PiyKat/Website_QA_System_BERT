 Index Futures Explained . Index futures, like all future contracts, give the trader or investor the power and the commitment to deliver the cash value based on an underlying index at a specified future date. Unless the contract is unwound before the expiration through an offsetting trade, the trader is obligated to deliver the cash value on the expiry. An index tracks the price of an asset or group of assets. Index futures are derivatives meaning they are derived from an underlying assetâ€”the index. Traders use these products to exchange various instruments including equities, commodities, and currencies. For example, the S&P 500 index tracks the stock prices of 500 of the largest companies in the United States. An investor could buy or sell index futures on the S&P to speculate the appreciation or depreciation of the index.
