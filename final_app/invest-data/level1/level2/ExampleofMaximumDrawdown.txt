 Example of Maximum Drawdown . Consider an example to understand the concept of maximum drawdown. Assume an investment portfolio has an initial value of $500,000. The portfolio increases to $750,000 over a period of time, before plunging to $400,000 in a ferocious bear market. It then rebounds to $600,000, before dropping again to $350,000. Subsequently, it more than doubles to $800,000. What is the maximum drawdown? The maximum drawdown in this case is = ($350,000 – 750,000) / $750,000 = –53.33% Note the following points:
