 Building a Bull Call Spread . The bull call spread reduces the cost of the call option, but it comes with a trade-off. The gains in the stock's price are also capped, creating a limited range where the investor can make a profit. Traders will use the bull call spread if they believe an asset will moderately rise in value. Most often, during times of high volatility, they will use this strategy. The bull call spread consists of steps involving two call options. By selling a call option, the investor receives a premium, which partially offsets the price they paid for the first call. In practice, investor debt is the net difference between the two call options, which is the cost of the strategy.
