Get A Strong Hold On Profit With Strangles . The word "strangle" conjures up murderous images of revenge. However, a strangle in the world of options can be both liberating and legal. In this article, we'll show you how to get a strong hold on this strangle strategy. An option strangle is a strategy where the investor holds a position in both a call and put with different strike prices, but with the same maturity and underlying asset. Another option strategy, which is quite similar in purpose to the strangle, is the straddle. A straddle is designed to take advantage of a market's potential sudden move in price by having a trader have a put and call option with both the same strike price and maturity date. While both of the straddle and the strangle set out to increase a trader's odds of success, the strangle has the ability to save both money and time for traders operating on a tight budget.
