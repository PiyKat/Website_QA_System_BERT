 Real World Example of a Seasonal Adjustment . For example, the sales of running shoes bought in the summer exceed the amount bought in the winter. This increase is due to the seasonal factor that more people run, or participate in other outdoor activities requiring similar footwear, in the summer. The seasonal spike in running shoe sales can obscure the general trends in athletic footwear sales across the whole time series. A seasonal adjustment is therefore made to obtain a clear picture of the general trend.
