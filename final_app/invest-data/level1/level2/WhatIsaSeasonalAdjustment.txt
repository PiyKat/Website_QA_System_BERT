 What Is a Seasonal Adjustment? . A seasonal adjustment is a statistical technique designed to even out periodic swings in statistics or movements in supply and demand related to changing seasons. It can, therefore, eliminate misleading seasonal components of an economic time series. Seasonal adjustment is a method of data-smoothing that is used to predict economic performance or company sales for a given period. Seasonal adjustments provide a clearer view of nonseasonal trends and cyclical data that would otherwise be overshadowed by the seasonal differences. This adjustment allows economists and statisticians to better understand the underlying, base trends in a given time series. An annual rate that has been adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations in data are therefore known as the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR). To calculate the SAAR for a given year, divide the unadjusted rate for a given month by its seasonality factor, and then multiply that figure by 12 to extrapolate an annual rate. If quarterly data are being used instead, multiply by four.
