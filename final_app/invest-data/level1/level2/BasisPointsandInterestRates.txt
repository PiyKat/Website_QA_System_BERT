 Basis Points and Interest Rates . Often interest rates change from 25 to 50 basis points. But even an increase of a few basis points on an interest rate may result in an overall increase of all levels, whether in credit markets or real estate markets. The largest market moves, such as those between 100 and 200 points, are rare and often signal an impetus to fundamentally change the monetary policy of the country or correct a deteriorating economic environment. For example, a central bank, by changing its rates, can significantly impact the economy of a country. Thus, rising interest rates can slow growth but also inflation. Conversely, a sharp drop in interest rates will result in a boom in the economy because money is cheaper to obtain.
