 Credit Crunch Causes . A credit crunch often follows a period in which lenders are overly lenient in offering credit. Loans are advancedÂ to borrowers with questionable ability to repay, and, as a result, the default rate and presence of bad debt begin to rise. In extreme cases, such as the 2008 financial crisis, the rate of bad debt becomes so high that many banks become insolvent and must shut their doors or rely on a government bailout to continue. The fallout from such a crisis can cause the pendulum to swing in the opposite direction. Fearful of getting burned again by defaults, banks curtail lending activity and seek out only borrowers with pristine credit who present the lowest possible risk. Such behavior by lenders is known as a flight to quality.
