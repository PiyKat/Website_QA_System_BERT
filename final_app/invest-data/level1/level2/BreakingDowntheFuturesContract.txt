 Breaking Down the Futures Contract . "Futures contract" and "futures" refer to the same thing. For example, you might hear somebody say they bought oil futures, which means the same thing as an oil futures contract. When someone says "futures contract," they're typically referring to a specific type of future, such as oil, gold, bonds or S&P 500 index futures. The term "futures" is more general, and is often used to refer to the whole market, such as "They're a futures trader."
