 Mortgage Markets: A Brief History . During the twentieth century, mortgage lending took place mostly at banks, savings and loans, thrifts, and credit unions. The most common type of mortgage was a fixed-rate mortgage. Most of the financial institutions originating mortgages held the mortgages that they originated on their books. Fannie Mae was chartered by the U.S. Congress as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) in 1968, and Freddie Mac followed two years later. Fannie Mae was initially created in 1938 as part of the government, but things began to change quickly after its privatization in 1968. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created a liquid secondary market for mortgages. This meant that financial institutions no longer had to hold onto the mortgages they originated. They could sell mortgages on the secondary market shortly after origination. Selling mortgages freed up funds for creating additional mortgages. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had a positive influence on the mortgage market by increasing homeownership rates in the United States. However, allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to function as implied government-backed monopolies had unintended consequences. History has shown that these consequences far outweighed the benefits these organizations provided.
