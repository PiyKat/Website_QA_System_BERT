 Understanding Foreign Exchange Intervention . When a central bank increases the money supply through its various means of doing so, it must be careful to minimize unintended effects such as runaway inflation. The success of foreign exchange intervention depends on how the central bank sterilizes the impact of its interventions, as well as general macroeconomic policies set by the government. Two difficulties that central banks face are determining the timing and amount of intervention, as this is often a judgment call rather than a cold, hard fact. The amount of reserves, the type of economic trouble facing the country, and the ever-changing market conditions require that a fair amount of research and understanding be in place before determining how to take a productive course of action. In some case a corrective intervention may have to be taken shortly after the first attempt.
