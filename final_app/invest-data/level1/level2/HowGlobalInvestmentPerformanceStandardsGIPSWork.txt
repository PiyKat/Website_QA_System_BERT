 How Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) Work . The Global Investment Performance Standards are a "set of standardized, industry-wide ethical principles that guide investment firms on how to calculate and present their investment results to prospective clients," according to the CFA Institute. Because the standards are voluntary, investment firms can choose to comply with them or not. However, because the standards are in wide use worldwide, complying with them makes it easier for investment firms to do business in multiple countries, saving them the time of having to apply different performance calculation measures for investment presentations, depending on the locale. The CFA Institute says the standards: Investment management companies often make a point of indicating that they are "GIPS compliant." That can lend additional credibility to companies, especially those that do business outside the more mature markets of North America and Europe.
