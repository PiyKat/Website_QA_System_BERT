 What is a NINJA Loan? . A NINJA loan is a slang term for a loan extended to a borrower, with little or no attempt by the lender to verify the applicant's ability to repay. It stands for "no income, no job and no assets." Whereas most lenders require loan applicants to provide evidence of a stable stream of income or sufficient collateral, a NINJA loan ignores that verification process. NINJA loans were more common prior to the 2008 financial crisis. In the aftermath of the crisis, the U.S. government issued new regulations to improve standard lending practices across the credit market, which included tightening the requirements for granting loans. At this point, NINJA loans are rare, if not extinct.
