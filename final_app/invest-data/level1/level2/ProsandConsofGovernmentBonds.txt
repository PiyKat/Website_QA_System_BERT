 Pros and Cons of Government Bonds . As with all investments, government bonds provide both benefits and disadvantages to the bondholder. On the upside, these debt securities tend to return a steady stream of interest income. However, this return is usually lower than other products on the market due to the reduced level of risk involved in their investments.  The market for U.S. government bonds is very liquid, allowing the holder to resell them on the secondary bond market easily. There are even ETFs and mutual funds that focus their investment on Treasury bonds. Fixed rate bonds may fall behind during periods of increasing inflation or rising market interest rates. Also, foreign bonds are exposed to sovereign or governmental risk, changes in currency rates, and have a higher risk of default.  Some U.S. Treasury bonds are free of state and federal taxes. But, the investor of foreign bonds may face taxes on income from these foreign investments. Pay a steady interest income return Low risk of default for U.S. bonds Exempt from state and local taxes
