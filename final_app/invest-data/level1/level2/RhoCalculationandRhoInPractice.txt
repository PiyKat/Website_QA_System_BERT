 Rho Calculation and Rho In Practice . The exact formula for rho is complicated. But it is calculated as the first derivative of the option's value with respect to the risk-free rate. Rho measures the expected change in an option's price for a 1 percent change in a U.S. Treasury bill's risk-free rate. For example, assume that a call option is priced at $4 and has a rho of 0.25. If the risk-free rate rises 1 percent, say from 3 percent to 4 percent, the value of the call option would rise from $4 to $4.25. Call options generally rise in price as interest rates increase and put options generally decrease in price as interest rates increase. Thus, call options have positive rho, while put options have negative rho. Assume that put option is priced at $9 and has a rho of -0.35. If interest rates were to decrease from 5 percent to 4 percent, then the price of this put option would increase from $9 to $9.35. In this same scenario, assuming the call option mentioned above, its price would decrease from $4 to $3.75. Rho is larger for options that are in-the-money and decreases steadily as the option changes to become out-of-the-money. Also, rho increases as the time to expiration increases. Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPs), which are options that generally have expiration dates at least two years away, are far more sensitive to changes in the risk-free rate and thus have larger rho than shorter-term options. Though rho is a primary input in the Blackâ€“Scholes options-pricing model, a change in interest rates generally has a minor overall impact on the pricing of options. Because of this, rho is usually considered to be the least important of all the option Greeks.
