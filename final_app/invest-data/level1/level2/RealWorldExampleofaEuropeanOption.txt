 Real World Example of a European Option . An investor purchases a July call option on Citigroup Inc. (C) with a $50 strike price. The premium is $5 per contract—100 shares—for a total cost of $500 ($5 x 100 = $500). At expiration, Citi is trading at $75. In this case, the owner of the call option has the right to purchase the stock at $50—exercise their option—making $25 per share profit. When factoring in the initial premium of $5, the net profit is $20 per share or $2,000 (25 - $5 = $20 x 100 = $2000). Let's consider a second scenario whereby Citigroup's stock price fell to $30 by the time of the call option's expiration. Since the stock is trading below the strike of $50, the option isn't exercised and expires worthlessly. The investor loses the premium of $500 paid at the onset. The investor can wait until expiry to determine whether the trade is profitable, or they can try to sell the call option back to the market. Whether the premium received for selling the call option is enough to cover the initial $5 paid is dependent on many conditions including economic conditions, the company's earnings, the time left until expiration, and the volatility of the stock's price at the time of the sale. There's no guarantee the premium received from selling the call option before expiry will be enough to offset the $5 premium paid initially.
