 The Basics of Investment Time Horizons . An Investment Time Horizon is the period where one expects to hold an investment for a specific goal. Investments are generally broken down into two main categories: stocks (riskier) and bonds (less risky). The longer the Time Horizon, the more aggressive, or riskier portfolio, an investor can build. The shorter the Time Horizon, the more conservative, or less risky, the investor may want to adopt.
