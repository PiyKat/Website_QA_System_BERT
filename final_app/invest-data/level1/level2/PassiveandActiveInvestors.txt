 Passive and Active Investors . Investors may also adopt various market strategies. Passive investors tend to buy and hold various market indexes, and may optimize their allocation weights to certain asset classes based on rules such as Modern Portfolio Theory's (MPT) mean-variance optimization. Others may be stock pickers who invest based on fundamental analysis of corporate financial statements and financial ratios. One example of this would be the "value" investors who seek to purchase stocks with low share prices relative to their book value. Others may seek to invest long-term in "growth" stocks that may be losing money at the moment but are growing rapidly and hold promise for the future, Passive (indexed) investing is becoming increasingly popular, where it is expected to overtake active investment strategies as the dominant stock market logic by the year 2020. The growth of low-cost target-date mutual funds, ETFs and robo-advisors are responsible for this surge in popularity.
