 Alternative Measures . Unemployed people, plus people who are marginally attached to the labor force, plus those who are employed part-time for economic reasons, as a percentage of the labor force (plus marginally attached). ﻿U-6=Unemployed+MA+PTERLabor Force+MA×100where:MA=marginally attachedPTER=part-time for economic reasons\begin{aligned} &\text{U-6} = \frac { \text{Unemployed} + \text{MA} + \text{PTER} }{ \text{Labor Force} + \text{MA} } \times 100 \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{MA} = \text{marginally attached} \\ &\text{PTER} = \text{part-time for economic reasons} \\ \end{aligned}​U-6=Labor Force+MAUnemployed+MA+PTER​×100where:MA=marginally attachedPTER=part-time for economic reasons​﻿ This metric is the BLS' most comprehensive. In addition to the categories included in U-5, it accounts for people who have been forced to settle for part-time work even though they want to work full-time. This category is often referred to as "underemployed," although that label arguably includes full-time workers who are overqualified for their jobs. The denominator for this ratio is the same as in U-5.
