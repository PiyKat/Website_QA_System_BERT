 What Is a Bull Call Spread? . A bull call spread is an options trading strategy designed to benefit from a stock's limited increase in price.Â The strategy uses two call options to create a range consisting of a lower strike price and an upper strike price. The bullish call spread helps to limit losses of owning stock, but it also caps the gains. Commodities, bonds, stocks, currencies, and other assets form the underlying holdings for call options.
