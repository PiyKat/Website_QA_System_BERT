 What is a Vanilla Option . A vanilla option is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a given timeframe. A vanilla option is a call or put option that has no special or unusual features. Such options are standardized if traded on an exchange such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
