 What Is a European Option? . A European optionÂ is a version of an options contract that limits execution to its expiration date. In other words, if the underlying security such as a stock has moved in price an investor would not be able to exercise the option early and take delivery of or sell the shares. Instead, the call or put action will only take place on the date of option maturity. Another version of the options contract is the American options, which can be exercised any time up to and including the date of expiration. The names of these two versions should not be confused with the geographic location as the name only signifies the right of execution.
