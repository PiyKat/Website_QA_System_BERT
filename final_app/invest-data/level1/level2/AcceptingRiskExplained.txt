 Accepting Risk Explained . Many businesses use risk management techniques to identify, assess and prioritize risks for the purpose of minimizing, monitoring, and controlling said risks. Most businesses and risk management personnel will find that they have greater and more numerous risks than they can manage, mitigate, or avoid given the resources they are allocated. As such, businesses must find a balance between the potential costs of an issue resulting from a known risk and the expense involved in avoiding or otherwise dealing with it. Types of risks include uncertainty in financial markets, project failures, legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural causes and disasters, and overly aggressive competition. Accepting risk can be seen as a form of self-insurance. Any and all risks that are not accepted, transferred or avoided are said to be "retained." Most examples of a business accepting a risk involve risks that are relatively small. But sometimes entities may accept a risk that would be so catastrophic that insuring against it is not feasible due to cost. In addition, any potential losses from a risk not covered by insurance or over the insured amount is an example of accepting risk.
