 Stakeholders vs. Shareholders . Stakeholders are bound to a company with some type of vested interest, usually for a longer term and for reasons of greater need. A shareholder, meanwhile, has a financial interest, but a shareholder can sell a stock and buy different stock or keep the proceeds in cash; they do not have a long-term need for the company and can get out at any time. For example, if a company is performing poorly financially, the vendors in that company's supply chain might suffer if the company no longer uses their services. Similarly, employees of the company, who are stakeholders and rely on it for income, might lose their jobs. However, shareholders of the company can sell their stock and limit their losses.
