 An Example of Home Equity . If a homeowner purchases a home for $100,000, with a 20% down payment and covers the remaining $80,000 with a mortgage, the owner has equity of $20,000 in the house. If the market value of the house remains constant over the next 2 years, and $5,000 of mortgage payments are applied to the principal, the owner now possesses $25,000 in home equity. If the market value of the home had increased by $100,000 over those 2 years, and that same $5,000 from mortgage payments were applied to the principal, the owner would then have aÂ home equity of $125,000.
