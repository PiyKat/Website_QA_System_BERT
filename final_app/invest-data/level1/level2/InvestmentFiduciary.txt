 Investment Fiduciary . While it may seem as if an investment fiduciary would be a financial professional (money manager, banker, and so on), an investment fiduciary is any person who has the legal responsibility for managing somebody else's money. That means if you volunteered to sit on the investment committee of the board of your local charity or other organization, you have a fiduciary responsibility. You have been placed in a position of trust, and there may be consequences for the betrayal of that trust. Also, hiring a financial or investment expert does not relieve the committee members of all of their duties. They still have an obligation to prudently select and monitor the activities of the expert.Â
