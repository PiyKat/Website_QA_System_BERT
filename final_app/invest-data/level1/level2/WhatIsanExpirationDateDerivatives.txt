 What Is an Expiration Date? (Derivatives) . An expiration date in derivatives is the last day that derivative contracts, such as options or futures, are valid. On or before this day, investors will have already decided what to do with their expiring position. Before an option expires, its owners can choose to exercise the option, close the position to realize their profit or loss, or let the contract expire worthless.
