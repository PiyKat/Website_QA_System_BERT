 How Do Put Options Work? . A put option becomes more valuable as the price of the underlying stock depreciates relative to the strike price. Conversely, a put option loses its value as the underlying stock increases. Because put options essentially provide a short position in the underlying asset, they are used for hedging purposes or to speculate on downside price action. A protective put is used to ensure that losses in the underlying asset do not exceed a certain amount, namely the strike price. In general, the value of a put option decreases as its time to expiration approaches due to time decay, because the probability of the stock falling below the specified strike price decreases. When an option loses its time value, the intrinsic value is left over, which is equivalent to the difference between the strike price less the underlying stock price. If an option has intrinsic value, it is in the money (ITM). Out of the money (OTM) and at the money put options have no intrinsic valueÂ because there would be no benefit of exercising the option. Investors could short sell the stock at the current higher market price, rather than exercising an out of the money put option at an undesirable strike price. Time value, or extrinsic value, is reflected in the premium of the option. If the strike price of a put option is $20, and the underlying is stock is currently trading at $19, there is $1 of intrinsic value in the option. But the put option may trade for $1.35. The extra $0.35 is time value, since the underlying stock price could change before the option expires. Put options, as well as many other types of options, are traded through brokerages. Some brokers are better than others for a variety of reasons. Those who have an interest in options trading can check out Investopedia's list of best brokers for options trading.
