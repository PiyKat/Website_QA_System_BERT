 What Does the CCAPM Tell You? . The CCAPM provides a fundamental understanding of the relationship between wealth and consumption and an investor's risk aversion. The CCAPM works as an asset valuation model to tell you the expected premium investors require in order to buy a given stock, and how that return is affected by the risk that comes from consumption-driven stock price volatility. The quantity of risk related to the consumption beta is measured by the movements of the risk premium (return on asset - risk-free rate) with consumption growth. The CCAPM is useful in estimating how much stock market returns change relative to consumption growth. A higher consumption beta implies a higher expected return on risky assets. For instance, a consumption beta of 2.0 would imply an increased asset return requirement of 2% if the market increased by 1%. The CCAPM incorporates many forms of wealth beyond stock market wealth and provides a framework for understanding variation in financial asset returns over many time periods. This provides an extension of the CAPM, which only takes into account one-period asset returns.
