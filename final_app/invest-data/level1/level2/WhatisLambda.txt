 What is Lambda . One of the "Greeks," lambda is the ratio of the dollar price change of an option to a 1% change in the expected price volatility, also called the implied volatility, of an underlying asset. Lambda tells investors how much an option's price will change for a given change in the implied volatility, even if the actual price of the underlying stays the same.Â  Lambda's value is higher the further away an option's expiration date is and falls as the expiration date approaches. Just as individual options each have a lambda, an options portfolio has a net lambda that is determined by adding up the lambdas of each individual position. In options analysis, lambda is used interchangeably with the terms vega, kappa, and sigma.
