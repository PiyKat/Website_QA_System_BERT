 What is Alpha Risk? . Alpha risk is the risk in a statistical test that a null hypothesis will be rejected when it is actually true. This is also known as a Type I error. The null hypothesis in a statistical test usually states that there is no difference between the value being tested and a particular number, such as zero or one. When the null hypothesis is rejected, the person conducting the test is saying there is a difference between the tested value and the particular number. Essentially, alpha risk is the risk that a difference will be detected when no difference actually exists. The best way to decrease alpha risk is to increase the size of the sample being tested with the hope that the larger sample will be more representative of the population.
