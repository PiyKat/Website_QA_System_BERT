 Wall Street Rivals Join the Party . It should come as no surprise that competitors on Wall Street wanted in on the profit bonanza. They wanted to securitize and invest in the parts of the mortgage market that the federal government reserved for Fannie and Freddie. They found a way to do this through financial innovation, which was spurred on by historically low short-term interest rates. Wall Street began to make a liquid and expanding market in mortgage products tied to short-term interest rates, such as LIBOR, starting in about 2000. These adjustable-rate mortgages were sold to borrowers as loans that the borrower would refinance out of long before payments adjusted upward. They frequently had exotic characteristics, such as interest-only or even negative-amortization features. Home loans were often made with lax underwriting guidelines, leading to the growth of subprime mortgages. Investors such as pension funds, foreign governments, hedge funds, and insurance companies readily purchased the sophisticated securities Wall Street created from home mortgages. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac saw their market shares drop. They then began to purchase and guarantee an increasing number of loans and securities with low credit quality.
