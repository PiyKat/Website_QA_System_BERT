 The Relationship Between Liabilities and Assets . Assets are the things a company owns—or things owed to the company—and they include tangible items such as buildings, machinery, and equipment as well as intangible items such as accounts receivable, interest owed, patents or intellectual property. If a business subtracts its liabilities from its assets, the difference is its owner's or stockholders' equity. This relationship can be expressed as follows: ﻿Assets−Liabilities=Owner’s Equity\text{Assets}-\text{Liabilities}=\text{Owner's Equity}Assets−Liabilities=Owner’s Equity﻿ However, in most cases, this accounting equation is commonly presented as such: ﻿Liabilities+Equity=Assets\text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity} = \text{Assets}Liabilities+Equity=Assets﻿
