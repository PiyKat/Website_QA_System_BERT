 Important Aspects of a Portfolio Manager . Regardless of the investment approach, all portfolio managers need to have very specific qualities in order to be successful. The first is originating ideas. If the portfolio manager is active, then the ability to have original investment insight is paramount. With over 7,000 companies to choose from, active investors need to be smart about where they look. If the manager takes a passive approach, the originating insight comes in the form of the market index he's decided to mirror. Passive managers must also make smart choices about the index. Additionally, the way in which a portfolio manager conducts research is very important. Active managers make a list of thousands of companies and pair it down to a list of a few hundred. The shortlist is then given to fund analysts to analyze the fundamentals of the potential investments, after which the portfolio manager assesses the companies and makes an investment decision. Passive managers also conduct research by looking at the various passive approaches and choosing the one best-suited for the fund.
