 The Difference Between Shareholder's Equity and Equity . A company's equity typically refers to the ownership of a public company. For example, investors might own shares of stock in a publicly traded company. Equity, however, in more general terms could also refer to the level ownership of an asset. For example, an owner of a house with a mortgage on it might have equity in the house, but not own it outright. The home owner's equity would be the difference between the market price of the house and the current mortgage balance.
