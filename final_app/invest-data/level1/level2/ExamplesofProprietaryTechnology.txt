 Examples of Proprietary Technology . While the advantages of some proprietary technologies are clear, others are not so evident. And it's only through recombination with other technologies where the true value is uncovered—an effort now simply known as innovation. The story of Xerox and Apple’s Steve Jobs is a classic example. Not knowing what they had on their hands in the late 1970s, Xerox essentially gave away the idea behind a computer mouse to Jobs who went on to use the technology in Apple’s early computer designs. Proprietary technology is also a big part of the biotech industry. Let's say a company in this industry successfully develops a new drug to treat a major disease. By patenting the process, method, and the end result of the drug, the company can reap substantial rewards from its efforts to develop its proprietary technology.
