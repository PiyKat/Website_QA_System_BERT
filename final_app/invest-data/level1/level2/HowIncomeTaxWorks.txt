 How Income Tax Works . Most countries employ a progressive income tax system in which higher-income earners pay a higher tax rate compared to their lower-income counterparts. The United States imposed the first income tax during the War of 1812. Its original purpose was to fund the repayment of a $100 million debt incurred from war-related expenses. After the war, the tax was repealed and then reinstated during the early 20th century. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collects taxes and enforces tax law. The IRS employs a complex set of rules and regulations regarding reportable and taxable income, deductions, credits, et al. The agency collects taxes on all forms of income, such as wages, salaries, commissions, investments, and business earnings. The personal income tax the government collects can help to pay for programs and services such as Social Security, national security, schools, and roads.
