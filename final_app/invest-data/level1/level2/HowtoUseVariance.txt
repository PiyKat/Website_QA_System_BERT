 How to Use Variance . Variance measures variability from the average or mean. To investors, variability is volatility, and volatility is a measure of risk. Therefore, the variance statistic can help determine the risk an investor assumes when purchasing a specific security. A large variance indicates that numbers in the set are far from the mean and from each other, while a small variance indicates the opposite. Variance can be negative. A variance value of zero indicates that all values within a set of numbers are identical. All variances that are not zero will be positive numbers.
