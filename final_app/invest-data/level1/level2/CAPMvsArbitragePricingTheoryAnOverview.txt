 CAPM vs. Arbitrage Pricing Theory: An Overview . In the 1960s, Jack Treynor, William F. Sharpe, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin developed the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to determine the theoretical appropriate rate that an asset should return given the level of risk assumed. Thereafter, in 1976, economist Stephen Ross developed the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) as an alternative to the CAPM. The APT introduced a framework that explains the expected theoretical rate of return of an asset, or portfolio, in equilibrium as a linear function of the risk of the asset, or portfolio, with respect to a set of factors capturing systematic risk.
