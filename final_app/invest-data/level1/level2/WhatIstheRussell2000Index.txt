 What Is the Russell 2000 Index? . The Russell 2000 index is an index measuring the performance of approximately 2,000 smallest-cap American companies in the Russell 3000 Index, which is made up of 3,000 of the largest U.S. stocks. It is a market-cap weighted index. Many investors compare small-cap mutual fund performance with the Russell 2000 index because it reflects the return opportunity presented by the entire sub-section of that market rather than opportunities offered by narrower indices, which may contain biases or more stock-specific risk that distort a fund manager’s performance.
