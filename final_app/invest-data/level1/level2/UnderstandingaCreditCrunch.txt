 Understanding a Credit Crunch . A credit crunch is an economic condition in which investment capital is hard to secure. Banks and other traditional financial institutions become wary of lending funds to individuals and corporations as they are afraid that the borrowers will default. This causes interest rates to rise as a way to compensate the lender for taking on the additional risk. Sometimes called a credit squeeze or credit crisis, a credit crunch tends to occur independently of a sudden change in interest rates. Individuals and businesses that could formerly obtain loans to finance major purchases or expand operations suddenly find themselves unable to acquire such funds. The ensuing ripple effect can be felt throughout the entire economy, as home-ownership rates drop and businesses are forced to cut back due to a dearth of capital.
