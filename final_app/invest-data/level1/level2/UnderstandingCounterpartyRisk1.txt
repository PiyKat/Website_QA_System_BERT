 Understanding Counterparty Risk . If the borrower has a low credit score, the creditor will likely charge a higher interest rate or premium due to the risk of default on the debt. Credit card companies, for example, charge interest rates in excess of 20% for those with low credit scores while simultaneously offer 0% interest for customers that have stellar credit or high credit scores. If the borrower is delinquent on payments by 60 days or more or exceeds the card's credit limit, credit card companies usually tack on a risk premium or a "penalty rate," which can bring the interest rate of the card to over 29% annually.
