 Derivatives vs. Options: An Overview . A derivative is a financial contract that gets its value, risk, and basic term structure from an underlying asset. Options are one category of derivatives and give the holder the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset. Options are available for many investments including equities, currencies, and commodities. Derivatives are contracts between two or more parties in which the contract value is based on an agreed-upon underlying security or set of assets such as the S&P index. Typical underlying securities for derivatives include bonds, interest rates, commodities, market indexes, currencies, and stocks.  Derivatives have a price and expiration date or settlement date that can be in the future. As a result, derivatives, including options, are often used as hedging vehicles to offset the risk associated with an asset or portfolio. Derivatives have been used to hedge risk for many years in the agricultural industry, where one party can make an agreement to sell crops or livestock to another counterparty who agrees to buy those crops or livestock for a specific price on a specific date. These bilateral contracts were revolutionary when first introduced, replacing oral agreements and the simple handshake.
