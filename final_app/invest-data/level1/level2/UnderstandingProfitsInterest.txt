 Understanding Profits Interest . When starting a business, many entrepreneurs choose to structure their entity as an LLC taxed as a partnership because such a structure allows them to use pass-through tax treatment and provides for the personal use of losses. But one option not available to entrepreneurs using this structure is the ability to issue equity stock options to motivate, reward and retain key employees. That's where the profits interest come in.   A profits interest represents an actual interest in the ownership of a partnership. As such, it differs from a stock option (another form of awarding an ownership stake), which grants to the holder a right to buy into a company at a time in the future. A profits interest may be tax-free to its recipient if structured to be compliant with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) safe-harbor rules for partnership profits interest, as it represents an ownership interest in future growth of an LLC or partnership, rather than an interest based on its current value. A profits interest serves as an incentive for partners to become more proactive in pursuing greater profitability, thus contributing towards the companies' growth. It also provides a tax benefit to recipients, as all appreciation in value is taxed as long-term capital gains rather than as ordinary income.
