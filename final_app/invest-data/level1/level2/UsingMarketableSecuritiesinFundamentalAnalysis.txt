 Using Marketable Securities in Fundamental Analysis . Marketable securities are evaluated by analysts when conducting liquidity ratio analysis on a company or sector. The liquidity ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations as they come due. In other words, this ratio assesses whether a company can pay its short-term debts using its most liquid assets. Liquidity ratios include: 1. Cash ratio: ﻿Cash Ratio=MCSCurrent Liabilitieswhere:MCS=Market Value of Cash and Marketable Securities\begin{aligned} &\text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{ \text{MCS} }{ \text{Current Liabilities} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{MCS} = \text{Market Value of Cash and Marketable Securities} \\ \end{aligned}​Cash Ratio=Current LiabilitiesMCS​where:MCS=Market Value of Cash and Marketable Securities​﻿ The cash ratio is calculated as the sum of the market value of cash and marketable securities divided by a company's current liabilities. Creditors prefer a ratio above 1 since this means that a firm will be able to cover all its short-term debt if they came due now. However, most companies have a low cash ratio since holding too much cash or investing heavily in marketable securities is not a highly profitable strategy. 2. Current ratio: ﻿Current Ratio=Current AssetsCurrent Liabilities\begin{aligned} &\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{ \text{Current Assets} }{ \text{Current Liabilities} } \\ \end{aligned}​Current Ratio=Current LiabilitiesCurrent Assets​​﻿
