Credit Agency . A credit agency is a for-profit company that collects information about individuals' and businesses' debtsÂ and assigns a numerical value called a credit score that indicates the borrower's creditworthiness. Creditors and lenders, such as credit card companies and banks, report their customers' borrowing activity and history to credit agencies. Individuals and businesses can obtain copies of the information reported about them by contacting the credit agency or a related third-party company and paying a nominal fee.
