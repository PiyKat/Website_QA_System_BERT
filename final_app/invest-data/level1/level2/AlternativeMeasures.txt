 Alternative Measures . In response to concerns that the official rate does not fully convey the health of the labor market, the BLS publishes five alternative measures: U-1, U-2, U-4, U-5, and U-6. Though these are often referred to as unemployment rates (U-6, in particular, is often called the "real" unemployment rate), U-3 is technically the only unemployment rate. The others are measures of "labor underutilization."  People who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer, expressed as a percentage of the labor force. ﻿U-1=Unemployed 15+ WeeksLabor Force×100\begin{aligned} &\text{U-1} = \frac { \text{Unemployed 15+ Weeks} }{ \text{Labor Force} } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-1=Labor ForceUnemployed 15+ Weeks​×100​﻿ People who lost their jobs, or whose temporary jobs ended, as a percentage of the labor force. ﻿U-2=Job LosersLabor Force×100\begin{aligned} &\text{U-2} = \frac { \text{Job Losers} }{ \text{Labor Force} } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-2=Labor ForceJob Losers​×100​﻿  Unemployed people, plus discouraged workers, as a percentage of the labor force (plus discouraged workers).
