 Long Vs. Short Options and Delta . As a transition into looking at position delta, let's first look at how short and long positions change the picture somewhat. First, the negative and positive signs for values of delta mentioned above do not tell the full story. As indicated in figure 3 below, if you are long a call or a put (that is, you purchased them to open these positions), then the put will be delta negative and the call delta positive; however, our actual position will determine the delta of the option as it appears in our portfolio. Note how the signs are reversed for short put and short call. Figure 3: Delta signs for long and short options. The delta sign in your portfolio for this position will be positive, not negative. This is because the value of the position will increase if the underlying increases. Likewise, if you are short a call position, you will see that the sign is reversed. The short call now acquires a negative delta, which means that if the underlying rises, the short call position will lose value. This concept leads us into position delta. (Many of the intricacies involved in trading options is minimized or eliminated when trading synthetic options.)
