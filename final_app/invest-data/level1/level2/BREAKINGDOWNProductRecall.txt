 BREAKING DOWN Product Recall . While the process behind a recall can vary depending on local laws, there are some general steps that occur. For example, if a pet food manufacturer releases a batch of product that contains an ingredient that may accidentally poison animals, the company will publicly announce the dangers of the food and request that its customers return the product to the firm, or simply discard it. Customers will usually be given a full refund or replacement. A public relations campaign is often created to handle the publicity surrounding the event. Recalls may negatively affect a company's stock. Concerns grow over a company's capabilities when a dangerous product is released, and customers may turn away from purchasing its goods in the future, leading to declining sales. Some recalls may ban the sale of an item, while others may ask consumers to voluntarily return a defective item for replacement or repair. In certain examples, such as an automobile recall, a seller may provide a new part or perform a diagnostic that reduces the danger of using the product.
