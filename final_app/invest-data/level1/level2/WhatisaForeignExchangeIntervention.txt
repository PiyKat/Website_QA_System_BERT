 What is a Foreign Exchange Intervention? . A foreign exchange intervention is a monetary policy tool used by a central bank. When the central bank takes an active, participatory role in influencing the monetary funds transfer rate of the national currency. It usually does so with its own reserves or is own authority to generate the currency. Central banks, especially those in developing countries, intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to build reserves for themselves or provide them to the country's banks. Their aim is often to stabilize the exchange rate.
