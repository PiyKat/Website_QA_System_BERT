 Understanding Full Faith And Credit . Full faith and credit refers to the full borrowing power of a government that pledges to fulfill its payment obligations in a timely manner. The U.S. Treasury issues bills, notes, and bonds as a means of borrowing money from the public to fund the governmentâ€™s capital projects. These securities require that interest payments be made to lenders and investors periodically. On the maturity date, bondholders expect full repayment of the face value of the securities. To encourage investors to purchase the debt issues, the Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the government, providing assurance to fixed income investors that the expected interest payments and principal repayments will be made regardless of the economic situation. Because Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the government, they are referred to as risk-free securities. The government cannot default on its obligations as it has the power to print more money or increase taxes in order to repay its debt. In addition, the interest rate on these risk-free securities also act as the benchmark rate for other fixed income securities that have some level of risk. In effect, the interest rate applied to debt instruments with risk is the risk-free rate plus a premium determined by the riskiness of the bond. Risk-averse investors looking for safe investment typically go for securities that are backed by the full faith and credit of the government. These securities offer lower yields than securities with risk in the markets. However, investors are willing to accept the low yield in return for capital preservation and expected interest income.
