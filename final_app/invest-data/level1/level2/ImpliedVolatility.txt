 Implied Volatility . Implied volatility is the estimated volatility, or gyrations, of a security's price and is most commonly used when pricing options. Usually, but not always, implied volatility increases while the market is bearish, or when investors believe the asset's price will decline over time. It usually, but not always, decreases when the market is bullish, or when investors believe that the price will rise over time. This movement is due to the common belief that bearish markets are riskier than bullish markets. Implied volatility is a way of estimating the future fluctuations of a security's worth based on certain predictive factors. As stated previously, lambda measures the theoretical percentage price change for each percentage move in implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is calculated using an options pricing model and determines what the current market prices are estimating an underlying asset's future volatility to be. However, the implied volatility may deviate from the realized future volatility.
