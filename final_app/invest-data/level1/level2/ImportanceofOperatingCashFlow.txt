 Importance of Operating Cash Flow . Financial analysts sometimes prefer to look at cash flow metrics because they strip away certain accounting anomalies. Operating cash flow, specifically, provides a clearer picture of the current reality of the business operations. For example, booking a large sale provides a big boost to revenue, but if the company is having a hard time collecting the cash, then it is not a true economic benefit for the company. On the other hand, a company may be generating a high operating cash flow but reports a very low net income if it has a lot of fixed assets and uses accelerated depreciation calculations. If a company is not bringing in enough money from their core business operations, they will need to find temporary sources of external funding through financing or investing. However, this is unsustainable in the long run. Therefore, operating cash flow is an important figure to assess the financial stability of a company's operations.
