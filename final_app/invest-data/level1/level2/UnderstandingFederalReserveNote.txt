 Understanding Federal Reserve Note . Federal Reserve notes were issued after the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. Before 1971, any Federal Reserve note issued was theoretically backed by an equivalent amount of gold held by the US Treasury. However, under President Nixon, the gold standard was officially abandoned, creating a fiat currency. In other words, Federal Reserve notes were no longer backed by hard assets. Instead, Federal Reserve notes are now backed solely by the government's declaration that such paper money was legal tender in the United States. The lifespan of the different Federal Reserve notes is dependent on its denomination. In general, the larger the denomination, the longer the lifespan because they are used less and people are more vigilant in holding onto them and keeping them well-kept. If you lose a $1 note, you may not blink; on the other hand, losing a $100 bill is a different story. According to the Federal Reserve, the average lifespan of each note is as follows: Colloquially, the term greenback is used for any denomination of a banknote. Some specific nicknames are Benjamin for a $100 bill and Tom for the $2 bill, both referencing the president depicted on the note.Â
