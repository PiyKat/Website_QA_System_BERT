 American Call and Put Options . A call option gives the holder the right to demand delivery of the underlying security or stock on any day within the contract period. This feature includes any day leading up to and the day of expiration. As with all options, the holder does not have an obligation to receive the share if they choose not to exercise their right. The strike price remains the same specified value throughout the contract. If an investor purchased a call option for a company in March with an expiration date at the end of December of the same year, they would have the right to exercise the call option at any time up until its expiration date. American options are helpful since investors don't have to wait to exercise the option when the asset's price rises above the strike price. However, American style options carry a premium—an upfront cost—that investors pay and which must be factored into the overall profitability of the trade. American put options also allow the execution at any point up to and including the expiration date. This ability gives the holder the freedom to demand the buyer takes delivery of the underlying asset whenever the price falls below the specified strike price.
