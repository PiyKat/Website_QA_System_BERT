 Example of Debt-to-Equity . Apple Inc. (AAPL) We can see below that for the fiscal year ending of 2017, Apple had total liabilities of $241 billion (rounded) and total shareholders' equity of $134 billion, according to their 10K statement. Using the above formula, the debt-to-equity ratio for AAPL can be calculated as: Debt-to-equity = $241,000,000 ÷ $134,000,000 = 1.80 The result means that Apple had $1.80 of debt for every dollar of equity. But on its own, the ratio doesn't give investors the complete picture. It's important to compare the ratio to other similar companies. For example, for the end of 2017, General Motors had a debt-to-equity ratio of 5.03--far higher than Apple's. However, the two companies are players in different industries. And given the capital expenditures needed to operate manufacturing plants around the world, it makes sense that GM has a higher ratio since it's likely to have more liabilities. Comparing the ratios to company's within their industries presents a clearer picture of how the companies are performing.  Debt-to-equity for the fiscal year ending 2017:  We can see above that GM's debt-to-equity ratio of 5.03, compared to Ford's 6.37, is not as high as it was when compared to Apple's 1.80 debt-to-equity ratio. However, when comparing Apple to technology companies like Netflix and Amazon, it becomes apparent that Apple uses far less debt financing than those two companies. Of course, that's not to say that the debt-to-equity ratios for Amazon and Netflix are too high, however, that number may inspire investors to take a peek at the companies' balance sheets, to determine how they are using their debt to drive earnings.
