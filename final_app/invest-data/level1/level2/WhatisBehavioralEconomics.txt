 What is Behavioral Economics . Behavioral Economics is the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions. The two most important questions in this field are: 1. Are economists' assumptions of utility or profit maximization good approximations of real people's behavior? 2. Do individuals maximize subjective expected utility? Behavioral economics is often related with normative economics.
