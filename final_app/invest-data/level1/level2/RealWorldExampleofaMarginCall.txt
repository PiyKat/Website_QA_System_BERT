 Real World Example of a Margin Call . An investor buys $100,000 of Apple Inc. using $50,000 of his own funds and borrowing the remaining $50,000 from the broker. The investor's broker has a maintenance margin of 25%. At the time of purchase, the investor's equity as a percentage is 50%. Investor's equity is calculated as: Investor's Equity As Percentage = (Market Value of Securities - Borrowed Funds) / Market Value of Securities. So, in our example: ($100,000 - $50,000) / ($100,000) = 50%. This is above the 25% maintenance margin. So far, so good. But suppose, two weeks later, the value of the purchased securities falls to $60,000. This results in the investor's equity tumbling to $10,000 (the market value of $60,000 minus the borrowed funds of $50,000), or 16.67% ($60,000 - $50,000) / ($60,000) This is now below the maintenance margin of 25%. The broker makes a margin call, requiring the investor to deposit at least $5,000 to meet the maintenance margin. Why $5,000? Well, the amount required to meet the maintenance margin is calculated as:
