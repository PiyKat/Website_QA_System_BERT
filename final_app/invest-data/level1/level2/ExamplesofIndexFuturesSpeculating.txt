 Examples of Index Futures Speculating . An investor decides to speculate on the direction of the S&P 500. Index futures for the S&P 500 are valued at $250 multiplied by the index value. The investor buys the futures contract when the S&P index is valued at 2,000, resulting in the contract value of $500,000 (2000 x $250). Since index futures contracts don't require the investor to put up 100% of the contract, the investor is only required to maintain a small percentage in a brokerage account. The S&P index falls to 1900, and the futures contract is now only worth $475,000 (1900 x $250). The investor has incurred a $25,000 loss. If the index increases to 2100, the futures contract is now worth $525,000 (2100 x $250). The investor has earned a $25,000 profit.
