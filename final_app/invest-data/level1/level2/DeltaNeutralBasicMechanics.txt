 Delta Neutral Basic Mechanics . Long put options always have a delta ranging from -1 to 0, while long calls always have a delta ranging from 0 to 1. The underlying asset, typically a stock position, always has a delta of 1 if the position is a long position and -1 if the position is a short position. Given the underlying asset position, a trader or investor can use a combination of long and short calls and puts to make a portfolio's effective delta 0. If an option has a delta of one and the underlying stock position increases by $1, the option's price will also increase by $1. This behavior is seen with deep in-the-money call options. Likewise, if an option has a delta of zero and the stock increases by $1, the option's price won't increase at all (a behavior seen with deep out-of-the-money call options). If an option has a delta of 0.5, its price will increase $0.50 for every $1 increase in the underlying stock.
