 Bollinger Bands . In investing, standard deviations are chiefly used under the guise of Bollinger bands. Developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s, Bollinger bands are a series of lines that can help identify trends in a given security. At the center is the exponential moving average (EMA), which reflects the average price of the security over an established time frame. To either side of this line are bands set one to three standard deviations away from the mean. These outer bands oscillate with the moving average according to changing price action. In addition to numerous other useful applications, Bollinger Bands are used as an indicator of market volatility. When a security has experienced a period of great volatility, the bands are quite wide. As volatility decreases, the bands narrow, hugging closer to the EMA. Even the most range-bound charts experience brief spurts of volatility from time to time, after earnings reports or product releases, for example. In these charts, normally narrow Bollinger bands suddenly bubble out to accommodate the spike in activity. Once things settle again, the bands narrow. Because many investment techniques are dependent on changing trends, being able to identify highly volatile stocks at a glance can be an especially useful tool.
