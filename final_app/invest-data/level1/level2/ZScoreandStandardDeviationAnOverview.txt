 Z-Score and Standard Deviation: An Overview . Although the finance industry can be complex, an understanding of the calculation and interpretation of basic mathematical building blocks is still the foundation for success, whether in accounting, economics or investing. Standard deviation and Z-score are two such fundamentals. Z-scores can help traders gauge the volatility of securities. The score shows how far away from the mean—either above or below—a value is situated. Standard deviation is a statical measure that shows how elements are dispersed around the average, or mean. Standard deviation helps to indicate how a particular investment will perform, so, it is a predictive calculation. In finance, the Z-score helps to predict the probability of an entity filing for bankruptcy and is known as the Altman Z-score. A firm grasp of how to calculate and utilize these two measurements enables a more thorough analysis of patterns and changes in any data set, from business expenditures to stock prices.
