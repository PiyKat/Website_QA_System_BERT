 Understanding Fair Market Value (FMV) . The term fair market value is intentionally distinct from similar terms such as market value or appraised value because it considers the economic principles of free and open market activity, whereas the term market value simply refers to the price of an asset in the marketplace. Therefore, while a home's market value can easily be found on a listing, the fair market value is more difficult to determine. Similarly, the term appraised value refers to an asset's value in the opinion of a single appraiser, thus not immediately qualifying the appraisal as a fair market value. In cases where a fair market value is needed, however, an appraisal will usually suffice.  Due to the thorough considerations made by the term fair market value, it's often used in legal settings. For example, the fair market value of real estate is commonly used in divorce settlements and to calculate compensation related to the government's use of eminent domain. Fair market values are also often utilized in taxation, such as when determining the fair market value of property for a tax deduction after a casualty loss.
