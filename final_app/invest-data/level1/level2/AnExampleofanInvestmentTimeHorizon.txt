 An Example of an Investment Time Horizon . Let’s say two people marry, and while they live in the city now, they’d eventually like to move out to the ‘burbs in a few years. But they don’t have the money for a down payment, so they’ll need to start saving up. That’s a short-term investment horizon, so they’ll probably want to go with something relatively conservative, like a money market fund, to avoid any sharp swings in stocks. Meanwhile, they’ve both taken advantage of their employer’s 401k savings fund (an employer sponsored retirement fund, sometimes with employer matching!) And since they’re both young, that’s a long-term Time Horizon. Given the length of time until their retirement, they can afford to be very aggressive in their asset allocation, upwards of 90% stocks, as the long Investment Horizon should allow their portfolio to recover from any short-term downturns. Next a baby comes along! Now they have to start thinking about saving for college. That’s more of a medium/long-term goal, so they can be pretty aggressive in the beginning and then turn a little more conservative as high school graduation comes along. But there is a government saving plan (529) which allows your contributions to grow tax free, as long as they’re used for educational expenses.
