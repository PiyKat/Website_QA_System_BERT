 What Is an American Option? . An American option is a version of an options contract that allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. Another version or style of option execution is the European option that allows execution only on the day of expiration. An American style option allows investors to capture profit as soon as the stock price moves favorably. The names American and European have nothing to do with the geographic location but only apply to the style of rights execution.
