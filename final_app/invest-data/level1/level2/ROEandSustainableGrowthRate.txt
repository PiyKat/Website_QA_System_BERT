 ROE and Sustainable Growth Rate . Assume that there are two companies with an identical ROE and net income, but different retention ratios. Company A has an ROE of 15% and returns 30% of its net income to shareholders in a dividend, which means company A retains 70% of its net income. Business B also has an ROE of 15% but returns only 10% of its net income to shareholders for a retention ratio of 90%. For company A, the growth rate is 10.5%, or ROE times the retention ratio, which is 15% times 70%. business B's growth rate is 13.5%, or 15% times 90%. This analysis is referred to as the sustainable growth rate model. Investors can use this model to make estimates about the future and to identify stocks that may be risky because they are running ahead of their sustainable growth ability. A stock that is growing slower than its sustainable rate could be undervalued, or the market may be discounting risky signs from the company. In either case, a growth rate that is far above or below the sustainable rate warrants additional investigation. This comparison seems to make business B look more attractive than company A, but it ignores the advantages of a higher dividend rate that may be favored by some investors. We can modify the calculation to make an estimate of the stockâ€™s dividend growth rate which may be more important to income investors.
