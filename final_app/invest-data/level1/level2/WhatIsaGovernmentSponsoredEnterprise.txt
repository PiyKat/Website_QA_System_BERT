 What Is a Government-Sponsored Enterprise? . A government-sponsored enterprise is a quasi-governmental entity established to enhance the flow of credit to specific sectors of the American economy. Created by acts of Congress, these agencies, though privately held, provide public financial services. GSEs help to facilitate borrowing for all sorts of individuals, from students to farmers to homeowners. For example, the agency Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) was originally created as a GSE in the housing sector to encourage homeownership among the middle class and working class. Other mortgage GSEs, as they are called, include Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), which were introduced to improve the flow of credit in the housing market, while also reducing the cost of that credit.
