 The Short-Lived Fiduciary Rule . While the term "suitability" was the standard for transactional accounts or brokerage accounts, the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule, proposed to toughen things up for brokers. Anyone with retirement money under management, who made recommendations or solicitations for an IRA or other tax-advantaged retirement accounts, would be considered a fiduciary required to adhere to that standard, rather than to the suitability standard that was otherwise in effect. The fiduciary rule had a long—and ultimately unsuccessful—implementation. Originally proposed in 2010, it was scheduled to go into effect between April 10, 2017, and January 1, 2018. After President Trump took office it was postponed to June 9, 2017, including a transition period for certain exemptions extending through January 1, 2018. Subsequently, the implementation of all elements of the rule was pushed back to July 1, 2019. Before that could happen, the rule was vacated following a June 2018 decision by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court.
