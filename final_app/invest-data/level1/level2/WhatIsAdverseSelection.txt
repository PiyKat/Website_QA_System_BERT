 What Is Adverse Selection? . Adverse selection refers generally to a situation in which sellers have information that buyers do not have, or vice versa, about some aspect of product quality—in other words, it is a case where asymmetric information is exploited. Asymmetric information, also called information failure, happens when one party to a transaction has greater material knowledge than the other party. Typically, the more knowledgeable party is the seller. Symmetric information is when both parties have equal knowledge. In the case of insurance, adverse selection is the tendency of those in dangerous jobs or high-risk lifestyles to purchase products like life insurance. In these cases, it is the buyer who actually has more knowledge (e.g., about their health). To fight adverse selection, insurance companies reduce exposure to large claims by limiting coverage or raising premiums.
