 Weighted Average of Outstanding Shares . Since the number of outstanding shares is incorporated into key calculations of financial metrics such as earnings per share and because this number is so subject to variation over time, the weighted average of outstanding shares is often used in its stead in certain formulae. For example, say a company with 100,000 shares outstanding decides to perform a stock split, thus increasing the total amount of shares outstanding to 200,000. The company later reports earnings of $200,000. To calculate earnings per share for the overall inclusive time period, the formula would be as follows: (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock (200,000)) /Â Outstanding Shares (100,000 - 200,000) But it remains unclear which of the two variant outstanding share values to incorporate into the equation: 100,000 or 200,000. The former would result in an EPS of $1, while the latter would result in an EPS of $2. In order to account for this inevitable variation, financial calculations can more accurately employ the weighted average of outstanding shares, which is figured as follows: (Outstanding Shares x Reporting Period A) + (Outstanding Shares x Reporting Period B) In the above example, if the reporting periods were each half of a year, the resulting weighted average of outstanding shares would be equal to 150,000. Thus, in revisiting the EPS calculation, $200,000 divided by the 150,000 weighted average of outstanding shares would equal $1.33 in earnings per share.
