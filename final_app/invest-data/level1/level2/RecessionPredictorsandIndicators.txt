 Recession Predictors and Indicators . There is no single way to predict how and when a recession will occur. Aside from two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, economists assess several metrics to determine whether a recession is imminent or already taking place. According to many economists, there are some generally accepted predictors that when they occur together may point to a possible recession. First, are leading indicators that historically show changes in their trends and growth rates before corresponding shifts in macroeconomic trends. These include the ISM Purchasing Managers Index, the Conference Board Leading Economic Index, and the OECD Composite Leading Indicator. These are critically important to investors and business decision makers because they can give advance warning of a recession. Second are officially published data series from various government agencies that represent key sectors of the economy, such as housing starts and capital goods new orders data published by the US Census. Changes in these data may slightly lead or move simultaneously with the onset of recession, in part because they are used to calculate the components of GDP, which will ultimately be used to to define when a recession begins. Last are lagging indicators that can be used to confirm an economyâ€™s shift into recession after it has begun, such as a rise in unemployment rates.
