 Options . When most investors think of options, they usually think of equity options, which is a derivative that obtains its value from an underlying stock. An equity option represents the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a certain price, known as the strike price, on or before an expiration date. Options are sold for a price called the premium. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying stock while a put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying stock. If the option is exercised by the holder, the seller of the option must deliver 100 shares of the underlying stock per contract to the buyer. Equity options are traded on exchanges and settled through centralized clearinghouses, providing transparency and liquidity, two critical factors when traders or investors take derivatives exposure. American-style options can be exercised at any point up until the expiration date while European-style options can only be exercised on the day it is set to expire. Major benchmarks, including the S&P 500, have actively traded European-style options. Most equity and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) options on exchanges are American options while just a few broad-based indices have American-style options. Exchange-traded funds are a basket of securities—such as stocks—that track an underlying index.
