 BREAKING DOWN Redemption Mechanism . The redemption mechanism is a mechanism used by authorized ETF participants. It can also be referred to as the creation/redemption mechanism. Authorized participants are broker-dealers who sell and redeem shares for ETF issuers. They partner with ETF issuers throughout the market. Authorized participants have agreements in place with ETF issuers on the number of ETF shares the issuer chooses to create and redeem. This power allows them to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities arising from discounts and premiums to ETF NAV prices. It also creates a mechanism that keeps ETF prices trading close to their accounting NAV. Authorized participants and the redemption mechanism are unique from mutual funds or unit investment trusts. Open-end mutual funds can only be bought or sold at their NAV, which is calculated at the end of the trading day. Unit investment trusts can trade more fluidly, however the structure allows them to trade away from the NAV of the underlying portfolio. Closed-end funds are similar to unit investment trusts since they also trade throughout the day with prices that can differ from the NAV. Neither unit investment trusts nor closed-end funds has the advantage of authorized participants who can use the redemption mechanism to manage the market price.
