 Exercising Options . If Tesla misses its earnings expectations and the stock price falls below the $230 strike price, the investor has locked in a selling price of $230, through September, with the put option. The investor can sell the put after any increase in value or exercise the put: selling 1,000 shares at $230, gaining a profit of $165 ($230 - $65) per share. Once the put option is exercised (and a seller of the put has been assigned at $230 per share), the contract ceases to exist.
