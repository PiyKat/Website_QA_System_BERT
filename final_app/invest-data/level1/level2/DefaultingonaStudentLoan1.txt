 Defaulting on a Student Loan . A good first step is to contact your lender as soon as you realize that you may have trouble keeping up your payments. The lender may be able to work with you on a more attainable repayment plan or steer you toward one of the federal programs. It is important to remember that none of the programs are available to people whose student loans have gone into default. You may be sure the banks and the government are as anxious to get the money as you are about repaying it. Just make sure you alert them as soon as you see potential trouble ahead. Ignoring the problem will only make it worse.
