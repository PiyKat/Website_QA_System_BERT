 Basics of Expiration Dates . Expiration dates, and what they represent, vary based on the derivative being traded. The expiration date for listed stock options in the United States is normally the third Friday of the contract month or the month that the contract expires. On months that the Friday falls on a holiday, the expiration date is on the Thursday immediately before the third Friday. Once an options or futures contract passes its expiration date, the contract is invalid. The last day to trade equity options is the Friday prior to expiry. Therefore, traders must decide what to do with their options by this last trading day. Some options have an automatic exercise provision. These options are automatically exercised if they are in the money (OTM) at the time of expiry. If a trader doesn't want the option to be exercised, they must close out or roll the position by the last trading day. Index options also expire on the third Friday of the month, and this is also the last trading day for American style index options. For European style index options, the last trading is typically the day before expiration.
