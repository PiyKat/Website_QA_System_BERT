 The History of the Tobacco Tax . The first excise tax within the U.S. was introduced in 1791 by the secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Since excise taxes are levied on the sale and production for sale of tobacco products, the price offered to buyers is higher relative to the price of other goods and services. This is because the producers, manufacturers, and wholesalers pay the excise tax and in a bid to recover the tax paid on these products, they inflate the price which is transferred to the final consumers. Each state has different prices due to varying state tax rates in addition to a different manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer pricing and discounting practices.
