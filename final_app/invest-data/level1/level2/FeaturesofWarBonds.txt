 Features of War Bonds . The bonds sold for 50% to 75% of their face value and had denominations ranging from $10 to $1,000 depending on the year they were issued. The bonds were sold below their face value meaning that investors paid less than the face value initially and were paid the face value amount at maturity. In other words, War Bonds were zero-coupon bonds meaning they didn't pay interest payments throughout the year or coupon payments. Instead, investors earned the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the bond at maturity. War bonds were baby bonds, which meant they had smaller par values or face values than standard bonds, making them more affordable for retail investors. Another feature of the bonds was that they were nontransferable, meaning that only the bond purchaser could redeem the bonds in the future. War Bonds originally had a 10-year maturity, which resulted in a 2.9% return. Congress extended the interest that could be earned so that bonds sold from 1941 to 1965 accrued interest for 40 years. Bonds issued after 1965 accrued interest for 20 years. After the end of World War II, War Bonds became known as Series E bonds. The U.S. government continued issuing Series E bonds until 1980 when Series EE bonds replaced them. Besides the United States government, other countries issued war bonds including Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Austria-Hungary.
