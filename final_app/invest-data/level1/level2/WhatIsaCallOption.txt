 What Is a Call Option? . Call options are financial contracts that giveÂ the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock, bond, commodity or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. The stock, bond, or commodity is called the underlying asset. A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price. A call option may be contrasted with a put, which gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before expiration. This may be affected by the stock's moneyness, or in-or-out status.
