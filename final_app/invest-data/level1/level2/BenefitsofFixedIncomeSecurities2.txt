Fixed-income securities such as U.S. Treasuries are guaranteed by the government providing a safe return for investors Fixed-income securities have credit risk meaning the issuer can default on making the interest payments or paying back the principal Fixed-income securities typically pay a lower rate of return than other investments such as equities Inflation risk can be an issue if prices rise by a faster rate than the interest rate on the fixed-income security If interest rates rise at a faster rate than the rate on a fixed-income security, investors lose out by holding the lower yielding security
