 RoR vs. Stocks and Bonds . The rate of return calculations for stocks and bonds are slightly different. Assume an investor buys a stock for $60 a share, owns the stock for five years, and earns a total amount of $10 in dividends. If the investor sells the stock for $80, his per share gain is $80 - $60 = $20. In addition, he has earned $10 in dividend income for a total gain of $20 + $10 = $30. The rate of return for the stock is thus $30 gain per share, divided by the $60 cost per share, or 50%. On the other hand, consider an investor that pays $1,000 for a $1,000 par value 5% coupon bond. The investment earns $50 in interest income per year. If the investor sells the bond for $1,100 premium value and earns $100 in total interest, the investorâ€™s rate of return is the $100 gain on the sale plus $100 interest income divided by the $1,000 initial cost or 20%.
