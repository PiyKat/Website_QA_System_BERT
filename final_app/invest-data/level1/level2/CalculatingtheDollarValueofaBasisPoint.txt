 Calculating the Dollar Value of a Basis Point . Calculating the dollar value of basis points is a straightforward procedure in Excel. As an example, say we have a one-year loan of $1,000,000. Let’s calculate the value of a 1.5 basis-point change on an annual, quarterly or monthly basis. We would simply prorate the value of the change in basis by four if for a quarter period, and by 12 on a monthly time span. We multiply the value of the instrument we wish to compute the by the change in basis points. Here we multiply C9 by C11 and divide by 10,000. 10,000 corresponds to 0.01 of 1%. 0.01*0.01=0.0001. The "VLOOKUP" takes care of the prorating on a quarterly or monthly basis. Here we see that the value of 1.5 basis points on $1,000,000 prorated to a monthly basis corresponds to $12.50.
