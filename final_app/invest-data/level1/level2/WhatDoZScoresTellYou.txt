 What Do Z-Scores Tell You? . Z-scores reveal to statisticians and traders whether a score is typical for a specified data set or if it is atypical. In addition to this, Z-scores also make it possible for analysts to adapt scores from various data sets to make scores that can be compared to one another accurately. Usability testing is one example of a real-life application of Z-scores. Edward Altman, a professor at New York University, developed and introduced the Z-score formula in the late 1960s as a solution to the time-consuming and somewhat confusing process investors had to undergo to determine how close to bankruptcy a company was. In reality, the Z-score formula Altman developed ended up providing investors with an idea of the overall financial health of a company.
