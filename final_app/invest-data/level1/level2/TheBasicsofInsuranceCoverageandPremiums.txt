 The Basics of Insurance Coverage and Premiums . An insurance company provides insurance coverage based on identified risk variables, such as the policyholder's age, general health condition, occupation and lifestyle. The policyholder receives coverage within set parameters in return for payment of an insurance premium, a periodic cost based on the insurance company's risk assessment of the policyholder in terms of the likelihood of the policyholder filing a claim and the probable dollar amount of a claim filed. Higher premiums are charged to higher-risk individuals. For example, a person who works as a racecar driver is charged substantially higher premiums for life or health insurance coverage than a person who works as an accountant.
