 Closing Price vs. Adjusted Closing Price . A particularly dramatic change in price occurs when a company announces a stock split. When the change is made, the price displayed will immediately reflect the split. For example, if a company splits its stock 2-for-1, the last closing price will be cut in half. That's the adjusted closing price. A reverse stock split causes a similarly dramatic price change. A reverse stock split can be a sign of a company in trouble that is struggling to make its stock price look healthier, or at least keep it above the $1 threshold that can get it delisted from an exchange. A 1-for-10 reverse stock split, for example, can transform a stock that is trading at 18 cents per share into one that is trading at $1.80 per share.
