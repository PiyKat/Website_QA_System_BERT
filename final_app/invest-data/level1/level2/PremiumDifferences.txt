 Premium Differences . The flexibility of using an American option comes at a priceâ€”a premium to the premium. The increased cost of the option means investors need the underlying asset to move far enough from the strike price to make the trade return a profit. Also, if an American option is held to maturity, the investor would have been better off buying a lower-priced, European version option and paying the lower premium. Lower premium cost Allows trading index options Can be resold before the expiration date Settlement prices are delayed Cannot be settled for underlying asset early
