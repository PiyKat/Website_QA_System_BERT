 Calculating a Holding Period . Starting on the day after the security's acquisition and continuing until the day of its disposal or sale, the holding period determines tax implications. For example, Sarah bought 100 shares of stock on Jan. 2, 2016. When determining her holding period, she begins counting on Jan. 3, 2016. The third day of each month after that counts as the start of a new month, regardless of how many days each month contains. If Sarah sold her stock on December 23, 2016, she would realize a short-term capital gain or capital loss because her holding period is less than one year. If she sells her stock on Jan. 3, 2017, she would realize a long-term capital gain or loss because her holding period is more than one year. Holding period return can therefore be represented by the following formula: ﻿Holding Period Return=Income+(EOPV−IV)IVwhere:EOPV=end of period valueIV=initial value\begin{aligned} &\text{Holding Period Return} = \frac { \text{Income} + ( \text{EOPV} - \text{IV} ) }{ \text{IV} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{EOPV} = \text{end of period value} \\ &\text{IV} = \text{initial value} \\ \end{aligned}​Holding Period Return=IVIncome+(EOPV−IV)​where:EOPV=end of period valueIV=initial value​﻿
