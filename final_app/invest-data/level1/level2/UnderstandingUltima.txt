 Understanding Ultima . To understand ultima, it is helpful to back up to vega. Vega is the rate of change between the underlying asset's implied volatility and the option's value. A vega of 0.2 means the price of the option will move $0.20 for each 1% change in implied volatility. Vomma is the derivative of vega. Vomma tells a trader if vega will increase or decrease in relation to implied volatility. A positive vomma means if volatility increases the option's vega will increase, and if volatility falls then vega will decrease. A negative vomma indicates the opposite.  Ultima is thus a measure of how vomma will change as volatility changes.
