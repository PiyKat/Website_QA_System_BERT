 Defining Individual Hedges . Delta hedging aims to reduce, or hedge, the risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset by taking offsetting long and short positions. For example, a long call position may be delta-hedged by shorting the underlying stock. This strategy is based on the change in premium, or price of option, caused by a change in the price of the underlying security. Delta itself measures the theoretical change in premium for each $1 change in the price of the underlying. Gamma hedging attempts to reduce, or eliminate, the risk created by changes in an option's delta. Gamma itself refers to the rate of change of an option's delta with respect to the change in price of the underlying asset. Essentially, gamma is the rate of change of the price of an option. A trader who is trying to be delta-hedged or delta-neutral is usually making a trade that volatility will rise or fall in the future. Gamma hedging is added to a delta-hedged strategy to try and protect a trader from larger changes in the portfolio than expected, or time value erosion.
