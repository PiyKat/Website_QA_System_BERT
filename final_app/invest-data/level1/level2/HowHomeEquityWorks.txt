 How Home Equity Works . If a portion, or all, of a home, is purchased by means of a mortgage, the lending institution has an interest in the home until the loan obligation has been met. Home equity is the portion of a home's current value that the owner actually possesses free and clear. Equity in a house can be attained either by a down payment during the initial purchase of the property or with mortgage payments––as a contracted portion of that payment will be assigned to bring down the outstanding principal still owed. Owners can benefit from property value appreciation as it will cause their equity value to increase.
