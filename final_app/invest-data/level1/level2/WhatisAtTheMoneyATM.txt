 What is At The Money (ATM)? . At the money (ATM) is a situation where an option's strike price is identical to the price of the underlying security. Both call and put options can be simultaneously ATM. For example, if XYZ stock is trading at $75, then the XYZ 75 call option is at the money and so is the XYZ 75 put option. An ATM option has no intrinsic value, but it may still have time value prior to expiration. Options trading activity tends to be high when options are ATM.
