 Formula and Calculation for ROE . ROE is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company if net income and equity are both positive numbers. Net income is calculated before dividends paid to common shareholders and after dividends to preferred shareholders and interest to lenders. ﻿Return on Equity=Net IncomeAverage Shareholders’ Equity\begin{aligned} &\text{Return on Equity} = \dfrac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}}\\ \end{aligned}​Return on Equity=Average Shareholders’ EquityNet Income​​﻿ Net Income is the amount of income, net of expense, and taxes that a company generates for a given period. Average Shareholders' Equity is calculated by adding equity at the beginning of the period. The beginning and end of the period should coincide with that which the net income is earned. Net income over the last full fiscal year, or trailing 12 months, is found on the income statement—a sum of financial activity over that period. Shareholders' equity comes from the balance sheet—a running balance of a company’s entire history of changes in assets and liabilities. It is considered the best practice to calculate ROE based on average equity over the period because of this mismatch between the two financial statements. Learn more about how to calculate ROE.
