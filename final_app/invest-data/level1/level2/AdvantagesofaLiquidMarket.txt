 Advantages of a Liquid Market . The main advantage of a liquid market is that investments can be easily transferred into cash at a good rate and in a timely fashion. For example, if someone owns $100,000 in U.S. Treasury bills and loses their job, the money in these Treasuries is easily accessible, and the value is known because it is a liquid market. However, on the other hand, real-estate property is not so liquid. Because there may be a small number of buyers for a given house in a given timeframe, it may take longer to sell the property. The faster you need to sell it, the lower the offer you will need to make to sell, which means you will receive less money you get for it.
