 GICS Sectors . Sectors typically are considered to be broad classifications. Within each sector, numerous sub-sectors and industries can be further delineated. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) is the primary financial industry standard for defining sector classifications. There are several ETFs that track benchmark indices in these sectors. GICS was developed by index providers MSCI and Standard and Poorâ€™s. Its hierarchy begins with 11 sectors which can be further delineated to 24 industry groups, 68 industries, and 157 sub-industries. It follows a coding system which assigns a code from each grouping to every company publicly traded in the market. The GICS coding system is integrated throughout the industry allowing for detailed reporting and stock screening through financial technology.
