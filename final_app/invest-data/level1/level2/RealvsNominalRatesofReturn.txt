 Real vs. Nominal Rates of Return . The simple rate of return used in the first example above with buying a home is considered a nominal rate of return since it does not account for the effect of inflation over time. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, and so $335,000 six years from now is not the same as $335,000 today. Likewise, $250,000 today is not worth the same as $250,000 six years from now. Discounting is one way to account for the time value of money. Once the effect of inflation is taken into account, we call that the real rate of return (or the inflation-adjusted rate of return).
