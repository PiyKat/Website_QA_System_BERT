 Understanding Normal Distribution . The normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis and in other types of statistical analyses. The standard normal distribution has two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. For a normal distribution, 68% of the observations are within +/- one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within +/- two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within +- three standard deviations. The normal distribution model is motivated by the Central Limit Theorem. This theory states that averages calculated from independent, identically distributed random variables have approximately normal distributions, regardless of the type of distribution from which the variables are sampled (provided it has finite variance). Normal distribution is sometimes confused with symmetrical distribution. Symmetrical distribution is one where a dividing line produces two mirror images, but the actual data could be two humps or a series of hills in addition to the bell curve that indicates a normal distribution.
