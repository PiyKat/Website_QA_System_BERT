 S&P 500 . Outside of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the S&P 500 is the best-known barometer for large-cap stocks in the United States. The index has been around since 1923 but assumed its present format in 1957. As the name suggests, it's composed of 500 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the country. The index is used as the benchmark for dozens of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With one index holding 500 stocks and the other holding 1,000, the composition of the two indices are clearly different. While the S&P 500 is composed primarily of large-cap stocks, defined by at least a $4 billion market cap, the Russell 1000 collects more mid-cap stocks to fill out its portfolio composition. The S&P 500 and Russell 1000 determine inclusion using relatively similar methodologies. To be included, both indices require that their components be defined as "U.S. companies." They both look at factors such as where the company is headquartered, where it derives revenue, and where most of its assets are located. Stocks must also trade on either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq.
