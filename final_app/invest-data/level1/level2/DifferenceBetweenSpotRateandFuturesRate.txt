 Difference Between Spot Rate and Futures Rate . The currency spot rate is the current quoted rate that a currency, in exchange for another currency, can be bought or sold at. The two currencies involved are called a "pair." If an investor or hedger conducts a trade at the currency spot rate, the exchange of currencies takes place at the point at which the trade took place or shortly after the trade. Since currency forward rates are based on the currency spot rate, currency futures tend to change as the spot rates changes. If the spot rate of a currency pair increases, the futures prices of the currency pair have a high probability of increasing. On the other hand, if the spot rate of a currency pair decreases, the futures prices have a high probability of decreasing. This isn't always the case, though. Sometimes the spot rate may move, but futures that expire at distant dates may not. This is because the spot rate move may be viewed as temporary or short-term, and thus is unlikely to affect long-term prices.
