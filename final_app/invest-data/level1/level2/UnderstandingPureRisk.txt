 Understanding Pure Risk . There are no measurable benefits when it comes to pure risk. Instead, there are two possibilities. On the one hand, there is a chance that nothing will happen or no loss at all. On the other, there may be the likelihood of total loss. Pure risks can be divided into three different categories: personal, property, and liability. There are four ways to mitigate pure risk: reduction, avoidance, acceptance, and transference.Â The most common method of dealing with pure risk is to transfer it to an insurance company by purchasing an insurance policy. Many instances of pure risk are insurable. For example, an insurance company insures a policyholder's automobile against theft. If the car is stolen, the insurance company has to bear a loss. However, if it isn't stolen, the company doesn't make any gain. This is in contrast to speculative risk, where the risk is measurable and results in a loss or gain.
