 The Altman Z-Score Formula . The Altman Z-score is the output of a credit-strength test that helps gauge the likelihood of bankruptcy for a publicly traded manufacturing company. The Z-score is based on five key financial ratios that can be found and calculated from a company's annual 10-K report. The calculation used to determine the Altman Z-score is as follows: ﻿ζ=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0Ewhere:Zeta(ζ)=The Altman Z-scoreA=Working capital/total assetsB=Retained earnings/total assetsC=Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)/totalassetsD=Market value of equity/book value of total liabilities\begin{aligned} &\zeta=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0E\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{Zeta}(\zeta)=\text{The Altman }Z\text{-score}\\ &A=\text{Working capital/total assets}\\ &B= \text{Retained earnings/total assets}\\ &C=\text{Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)/total}\\ &\qquad\text{assets}\\ &D=\text{Market value of equity/book value of total liabilities}\\ &E=\text{Sales/total assets} \end{aligned}​ζ=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0Ewhere:Zeta(ζ)=The Altman Z-scoreA=Working capital/total assetsB=Retained earnings/total assetsC=Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)/totalassetsD=Market value of equity/book value of total liabilities​﻿ Typically, a score below 1.8 indicates that a company is likely heading for or is under the weight of bankruptcy. Conversely, companies that score above 3 are less likely to experience bankruptcy.
