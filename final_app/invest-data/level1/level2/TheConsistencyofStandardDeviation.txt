 The Consistency of Standard Deviation . One of the reasons for the widespread popularity of standard deviation measurements is their consistency. Not only does one standard deviation from the mean represent the same thing whether you are talking about gross domestic product (GDP), crop yields, or the height of dogs, it is always calculated in the same units as the data set. You never have to interpret an additional unit of measurement resulting from the formula. For example, suppose a mutual fund achieves the following annual rates of return over the course of five years: 4 percent, 6 percent, 8.5 percent, 2 percent, and 4 percent. The mean value, or average, is 4.9 percent. The standard deviation is 2.46 percent, which means that each individual yearly value is an average of 2.46 percent away from the mean. Every value is expressed in a percentage and, now, the relative volatility is easier to compare among similar mutual funds. Due to its consistent mathematical properties, 68 percent of the values in any data set lie within one standard deviation of the mean, and 95 percent lie within two standard deviations of the mean. Alternatively, you can estimate with 95 percent certainty that annual returns do not exceed the range created within two standard deviations of the mean.
