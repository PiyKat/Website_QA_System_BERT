 How a NINJA Loan Works . Financial institutions that offer NINJA loans base their decision on a borrowerâ€™s credit score, with no verification of income or assets, such as through income tax returns, pay stubs or bank and brokerage statements. Borrowers need to have a credit score over a certain threshold in order to qualify. Since NINJA loans are generally provided through subprime lenders, however, their credit score requirements may be lower than those of mainstream lenders, such as major banks. NINJA loans are structured with varying terms. Some may offer an attractively low initial interest rate that increases over time. Borrowers are required to repay the debt according to a scheduled time frame. Failing to make those payments can cause the lender to take legal action to collect the debt, resulting in a drop in the borrower's credit score and ability to obtain other loans in the future.
