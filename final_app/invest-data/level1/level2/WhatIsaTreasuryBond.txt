 What Is a Treasury Bond? . A Treasury bond (T-bond) is a government debt security that earns interest until maturity, at which point the owner is also paid a par amount equal to the principal. Treasury bonds are part of the larger category of government bonds, a type of bond issued by a national government with a commitment to pay period interest payments known as coupon payments as well as the principal upon maturity. Treasury bonds are marketable, fixed-interest U.S. government debt securities with a maturity of more than 10 years. As is true for other government bonds, Treasury bonds make interest payments semiannually, and the income received is only taxed at the federal level. T-bonds are known in the market as primarily risk-free; they are issued by the U.S. government with very little risk of default. Silver stocks and other rare metals are often dependent on current treasury bond rates.
