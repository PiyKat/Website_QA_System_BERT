 Examples of Adverse Selection . Adverse selection for insurers occurs when an applicant manages to obtain coverage at lower premiums than the insurance company would charge if it were aware of the actual risk regarding the applicant, usually as a result of the applicant withholding relevant information or providing false information that thwarts the effectiveness of the insurance company's risk evaluation system. Potential penalties for knowingly giving false information on an insurance application range from misdemeanors to felonies on state and federal levels, but the practice occurs nonetheless. A prime example of adverse selection in regard to life or health insurance coverage is a smoker who successfully manages to obtain insurance coverage as a nonsmoker. Smoking is a key identified risk factor for life insurance or health insurance, so a smoker must pay higher premiums to obtain the same coverage level as a nonsmoker. By concealing his behavioral choice to smoke, an applicant is leading the insurance company to make decisions on coverage or premium costs that are adverse to the insurance company's management of financial risk. An example of adverse selection in the provision of auto insurance is a situation in which the applicant obtains insurance coverage based on providing a residence address in an area with a very low crime rate when the applicant actually lives in an area with a very high crime rate. Obviously, the risk of the applicant's vehicle being stolen, vandalized or otherwise damaged when regularly parked in a high-crime area is substantially greater than if the vehicle was regularly parked in a low-crime area. Adverse selection might occur on a smaller scale if an applicant states that the vehicle is parked in a garage every night when it is actually parked on a busy street.
