 Pros and Cons of NINJA Loans . Because NINJA loans require so little paperwork compared, for example, with traditional home mortgages or business loans, an application for one can be processed quickly. That makes them appealing to some borrowers, especially those who lack the customary documentation or don't wish to produce it. The loans can, however, be very risky â€“ for lender and borrower alike. Because NINJA loans require no evidence of collateral, they are not secured by any assets that a lender could seize if the borrower defaults on the loan.
