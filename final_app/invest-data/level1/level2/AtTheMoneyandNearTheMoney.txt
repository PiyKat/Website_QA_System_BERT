 At The Money and Near The Money . The term "near the money" is sometimes used to describe an option that is within 50 cents of being at the money. For example, assume an investor purchases a call option with a strike price of $50.50 and the underlying stock price is trading at $50. The call option is said to be near the money. The option wouldÂ be near the money if the underlying stock price was trading between about $49.50 and $50.50, in this case. Near the money and at the money options are attractive when traders expect a big movement. Options that are even further out of the money may also see a jump when a swing is anticipated.
