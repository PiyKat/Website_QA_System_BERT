 Skewness and Kurtosis . Real life data rarely, if ever, follow a perfect normal distribution. The skewness and kurtosis coefficients measure how different a given distribution is from a normal distribution. The skewness measures the symmetry of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric and has a skewness of zero. If the distribution of a data set has a skewness less than zero, or negative skewness, then the left tail of the distribution is longer than the right tail; positive skewness implies that the right tail of the distribution is longer than the left. The kurtosis statistic measures the thickness of the tail ends of a distribution in relation to the tails of the normal distribution. Distributions with large kurtosis exhibit tail data exceeding the tails of the normal distribution (e.g., five or more standard deviations from the mean). Distributions with low kurtosis exhibit tail data that is generally less extreme than the tails of the normal distribution. The normal distribution has a kurtosis of three, which indicates the distribution has neither fat nor thin tails. Therefore, if an observed distribution has a kurtosis greater than three, the distribution is said to have heavy tails when compared to the normal distribution. If the distribution has a kurtosis of less than three, it is said to have thin tails when compared to the normal distribution.
