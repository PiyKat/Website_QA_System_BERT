 Beta Examples . Beta could be calculated by first dividing the security's standard deviation of returns by the benchmark's standard deviation of returns. The resulting value is multiplied by the correlation of the security's returns and the benchmark's returns. Calculating the Beta for Apple Inc. (AAPL): An investor is looking to calculate the beta of Apple Inc. (AAPL) as compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Based on data over the past five years, the correlation between AAPL, and SPY is 0.83. AAPL has a standard deviation of returns of 23.42% and SPY has a standard deviation of returns of 32.21%. ﻿Beta of AAPL=0.83×(0.23420.3221)=0.6035\begin{aligned} &\text{Beta of AAPL} = 0.83 \times \left ( \frac{ 0.2342 }{ 0.3221 } \right ) = 0.6035 \\ \end{aligned}​Beta of AAPL=0.83×(0.32210.2342​)=0.6035​﻿ In this case, Apple is considered less volatile than the market exchange-traded fund (ETF) as its beta of 0.6035 indicates that the stock theoretically experiences 40% less volatility than the SPDR S&P 500 Exchange Traded Fund Trust. Calculating the Beta for Tesla Inc. (TSLA): Let's assume the investor also wants to calculate the beta of Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) in comparison to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Based on data over the past five years, TSLA and SPY have a covariance of 0.032, and the variance of SPY is 0.015. ﻿Beta of TLSA=0.0320.015=2.13\begin{aligned} &\text{Beta of TLSA} = \frac{ 0.032 }{ 0.015 } = 2.13 \\ \end{aligned}​Beta of TLSA=0.0150.032​=2.13​﻿ Therefore, TSLA is theoretically 113% more volatile than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust.
