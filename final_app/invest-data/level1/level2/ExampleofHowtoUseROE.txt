 Example of How to Use ROE . For example, imagine a company with an annual income of $1,800,000 and average shareholders' equity of $12,000,000. This company’s ROE would be as follows: ﻿ROE=($1,800,000$12,000,000)=15%ROE=\left(\frac{\$1,800,000}{\$12,000,000}\right )=15\%ROE=($12,000,000$1,800,000​)=15%﻿ Consider Apple Inc. (AAPL)—for the fiscal year ending Sept. 29, 2018, the company generated US$59.5 billion in net come. At the end of the fiscal year, it’s shareholders’ equity was $107.1 billion versus $134 billion at the beginning. Apple’s return on equity, therefore, is 49.4%, or $59.5 billion / (($107.1 billion + $134 billion) / 2). Compared to its peers, Apple has a very strong ROE.
