 Iron Condor Profits and Losses . The maximum profit for an iron condor is the amount of premium, or credit, received for creating the four-leg options position. The maximum loss is also capped. The maximum loss is the difference between the long call and short call strikes, or the long put and short put strikes. Reduce the loss by the net credits received, but then add commissions to get the total loss for the trade. The maximum loss occurs if the price moves above the long call strike (which is higher than the sold call strike) or below the long put strike (which is lower than the sold put strike).
