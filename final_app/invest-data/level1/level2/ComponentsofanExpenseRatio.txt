 Components of an Expense Ratio . Most expenses within a fund are variable; however, the variable expenses are fixed within the fund. For example, a fee consuming .5% of the fund's assets will always consume .5% of the assets regardless of how it varies. In addition to the management fees associated with a fund, some funds have an advertising and promotion expense referred to as a 12b-1 fee, which is included in operating expenses. Notably, 12b-f fees within a fund cannot exceed 1% (0.75% allocated to distribution and 0.25% allocated to shareholder servicing) according to FINRA rules. A fund's trading activity, the buying, and selling of portfolio securities is not included in the calculation of the expense ratio. Costs not included in operating expenses are loads, contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC), and redemption fees, which, if applicable, are paid directly by fund investors.
