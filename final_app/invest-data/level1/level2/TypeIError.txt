Type I Error . A type I error is a kind of fault that occurs during the hypothesis testing process when a null hypothesis is rejected, even though it is accurate and should not be rejected. In hypothesis testing, a null hypothesis is established before the onset of a test. In some cases, the null hypothesis assumes the absence of a cause and effect relationship between the item being tested and the stimuli being applied to the test subject to trigger an outcome to the test. This condition is denoted as "n=0." If—when the test is conducted—the result seems to indicate that the stimuli applied to the test subject cause a reaction then the null hypothesis that the stimuli do not affect the test subject will be rejected.
