 Capital Asset Pricing Model . The CAPM allows investors to quantify the expected return on an investment given the investment risk, risk-free rate of return, expected market return, and the beta of an asset or portfolio. The risk-free rate of return that is used is typically the federal funds rate or the 10-year government bond yield. An asset's or portfolio's beta measures the theoretical volatility in relation to the overall market. For example, if a portfolio has a beta of 1.25 in relation to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), it is theoretically 25 percent more volatile than the S&P 500 Index. Therefore, if the index rises by 10 percent, the portfolio rises by 12.5 percent. If the index falls by 10 percent, the portfolio falls by 12.5 percent. The formula used in CAPM is: E(ri) = rf + βi * (E(rM) - rf), where rf is the risk-free rate of return, βi is the asset's or portfolio's beta in relation to a benchmark index, E(rM) is the expected benchmark index's returns over a specified period, and E(ri) is the theoretical appropriate rate that an asset should return given the inputs.
