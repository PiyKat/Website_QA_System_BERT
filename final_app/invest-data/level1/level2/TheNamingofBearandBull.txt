 The Naming of Bear and Bull . The term “bear market” is the opposite of a “bull market,” or market where prices for securities are rising or are expected to rise. The bear market phenomenon gets its name from the way in which a bear attacks its prey—swiping its paws downward. This is why markets with falling stock prices are called bear markets. Just like the bear market, the bull market is named after the way in which the bull attacks by thrusting its horns up into the air.
