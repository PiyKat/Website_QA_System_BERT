 How an Index Fund Works . "Indexing" is a form of passive fund management. Instead of a fund portfolio manager actively stock picking and market timing—that is, choosing securities to invest in and strategizing when to buy and sell them—the fund manager builds a portfolio whose holdings mirror the securities of a particular index. The idea is that by mimicking the profile of the index—the stock market as a whole, or a broad segment of it—the fund will match its performance as well. There is an index, and an index fund, for nearly every financial market in existence. In the U.S, the most popular index funds track the S&P 500. But several other indexes are widely used as well, including: So, an index fund tracking the DJIA, for example, would invest in the same 30, large and publicly-owned companies that comprise that venerable index. Portfolios of index funds substantially only change when their benchmark indexes change. If the fund is following a weighted index, its managers may periodically rebalance the percentage of different securities, to reflect the weight of their presence in the benchmark. Weighting is a method used to balance out the influence of any single holding in an index or a portfolio.
