 Avoidance . Avoidance is a method for mitigating risk by not participating in activities that may incur injury, sickness or death. Smoking cigarettes is an example of one such activity because avoiding it may lessen both health and financial risks.  According to the American Lung Association, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and claims more than 438,000 lives per year. Additionally, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention notes that smoking is the No. 1 risk factor for getting lung cancer, and the risk only increases the longer that people smoke.  Life insurance companies mitigate this risk on their end by raising premiums for smokers than nonsmokers. Under the Affordable Health Care Act, also known as Obamacare, health insurers are able to increase premiums based on age, geography, family size and smoking status. The law allows for up to a 50% surcharge on premiums for smokers.
