 Downside of Derivatives . On the downside, derivatives are difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. The risks for OTC derivatives include counter-party risks that are difficult to predict or value as well. Most derivatives are also sensitive to changes in the amount of time to expiration, the cost of holding the underlying asset,Â and interest rates. These variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of a derivative with the underlying asset. Lock in prices Hedge against risk Can be leveraged Diversify portfolio Hard to value
