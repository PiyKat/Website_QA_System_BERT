 The CFP® Designation . The most commonly held is the Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) designation issued by the Certified Financial Planner Board, a non-profit, certifying and standards-setting organization that administers the CFP exam. Certified Financial Planner is a formal credential of expertise in the areas of financial planning, taxes, insurance, estate planning, and retirement. Owned and awarded by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc., the designation is awarded to individuals who successfully complete the CFP® Board's initial exams, then continue ongoing annual education programs to sustain their skills and certification. A CFP® may to much more than simply advising on available investments. Whether providing help on budgeting, retirement planning, education savings, insurance coverage, or even tax-optimization strategy, “finances” doesn’t mean just one thing for most people — and “financial planning” means much more than just investing.
