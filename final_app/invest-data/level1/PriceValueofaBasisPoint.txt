 Price Value of a Basis Point . The Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) is a measure of the absolute value of the change in the price of a bond for a one basis point change in yield. It is another way to measure interest-rate risk, similar to duration, which measures the percent change in a bond price given a 1% change in rates. PVBP is just a special case of dollar duration. Instead of using a 100 basis point change, the price value of a basis point simply uses a 1 basis point change. It does not matter if there is an increase or decrease in rates because such a small move in rates will be about the same in either direction. This may also be referred to as DV01, or the dollar value change for a 1 bp move.
