 Mortgage-Backed Securities Today . MBSs are still bought and sold today. There is a market for them again simply because people generally pay their mortgages if they can. The Fed still owns a huge chunk of the market for MBSs, but it is gradually selling off its holdings. Even CDOs have returned after falling out of favor for a few years post-crisis. The assumption is that Wall Street has learned its lesson and will question the value of MBSs rather than blindly buying them. Time will tell.
