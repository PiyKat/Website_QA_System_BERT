 Examples of Beta Risk . An interesting application of hypothesis testing in finance can be made using the Altman Z-score. The Z-score is a statistical model meant to predict the future bankruptcy of firms based on certain financial indicators. Statistical tests of the accuracy of the Z-score have indicated relatively high accuracy, predicting bankruptcy within one year. These tests show a beta risk (firms predicted to go bankrupt but did not) ranging from approximately 15% to 20%, depending on the sample being tested.
