 Using Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is an especially useful tool in investing and trading strategies as it helps measure market and security volatilityâ€”and predict performance trends. As it relates to investing, for example, one can expect an index fund to have a low standard deviation versus its benchmark index, as the fund's goal is to replicate the index. On the other hand, one can expect aggressive growth funds to have a high standard deviation from relative stock indices, as their portfolio managers make aggressive bets to generate higher-than-average returns. A lower standard deviation isn't necessarily preferable. It all depends on the investments one is making, and one's willingness to assume the risk. When dealing with the amount of deviation in their portfolios, investors should consider their personal tolerance for volatility and their overall investment objectives. More aggressive investors may be comfortable with an investment strategy that opts for vehicles with higher-than-average volatility, while more conservative investors may not. Standard deviation is one of the key fundamental risk measures that analysts, portfolio managers, advisors use. Investment firms report the standard deviation of their mutual funds and other products. A large dispersion shows how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns. Because it is easy to understand, this statistic is regularly reported to the end clients and investors.
