 Example of Moral Hazard . For an example of moral hazard, consider the implications of buying insurance. Let's assume a homeowner does not have homeowners insurance or flood insurance and lives in a flood zone. The homeowner is very careful and subscribes to a home security system that helps prevent burglaries. When there are storms, he prepares for floods by clearing the drains and moving furniture to prevent damage. However, the homeowner is tired of always having to worry about potential burglaries and preparing for floods, so he buys the home and flood insurance. After his house is insured, his behavior changes and he is less attentive, he leaves his doors unlocked, cancelsÂ the home security system subscription and does not prepare for floods. In this case, the insurance company is faced with the risks of floods and burglaries and their consequences, and the problem of moral hazard arises.
