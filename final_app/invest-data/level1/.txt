 . Using basis points in conversation instead of talking in percentages instantly clarifies whether that "10% increase" in a financial instrument priced at 10% means that it's now at 11% [0.10 x (1 + 0.10) = 11% ] or 20% [10% + 10% = 20%]. By using basis points in conversation, traders and analysts remove some of the ambiguity that can arise when talking about things in percentage moves. For example, if a financial instrument is priced at a 10% rate of interest and the rate experiences a 10% increase, it could conceivably mean that it is now 0.10 x (1 + 0.10) = 11% or it could also mean 10% + 10% = 20%. The intent of the statement is unclear. The use of basis points, in this case, makes the meaning obvious: If the instrument is priced at a 10% rate of interest and experiences a 100 bp move up, it is now 11%. The 20% result would occur if there were instead a move of 1,000 bps.
