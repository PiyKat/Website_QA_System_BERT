 Understanding Active Risk . Active risk is the risk a manager takes on in their efforts to outperform a benchmark and achieve higher returns for investors. Actively-managed funds will have risk characteristics that vary from their benchmark. Generally, passively-managed funds seek to have limited or no active risk in comparison to the benchmark they seek to replicate. Active risk can be observed through comparison of multiple risk characteristics. Three of the best risk metrics for active risk comparisons include beta, standard deviation or volatility, and Sharpe Ratio. Beta represents a fundâ€™s risk relative to its benchmark. A fund beta greater than one indicates higher risk while a fund beta below one indicates lower risk. Standard deviation or volatility expresses the variation of the underlying securities comprehensively. A fund volatility measure that is higher than the benchmark shows higher risk while a fund volatility below the benchmark shows lower risk. The Sharpe Ratio provides a measure for understanding the excess return as a function of the risk. A higher Sharpe Ratio means a fund is investing more efficiently by earning higher return per unit of risk. (See also: 5 Ways to Measure Mutual Fund Risk)
