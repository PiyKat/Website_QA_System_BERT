 The Role of MBSs in the Financial Crisis . Mortgage-backed securities played a central role in the financial crisis that began in 2007 and went on to wipe out trillions of dollars in wealth, bring down Lehman Brothers, and roil the world financial markets. In retrospect, it seems inevitable that the rapid increase in home prices and the growing demand for MBS would encourage banks to lower their lending standards and drive consumers to jump into the market at any cost. That was the beginning of the subprime MBS. With Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae aggressively supporting the mortgage market, the quality of all mortgage-backed securities declined and their ratings became meaningless. Then, in 2006, housing prices peaked. Subprime borrowers started to default and the housing market began its long collapse. More people began walking away from their mortgages because their homes were worth less than their debts. Even the conventional mortgages underpinning the MBS market saw steep declines in value. The avalanche of non-payments meant that many MBSs and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) based off of pools of mortgages were vastly overvalued. The losses piled up as institutional investors and banks tried and failed to unload bad MBS investments. Credit tightened, causing many banks and financial institutions to teeter on the brink of insolvency. Lending was disrupted to the point that the entire economy was at risk of collapse. In the end, the U.S. Treasury stepped in with a $700 billion financial system bailout intended to ease the credit crunch. The Federal Reserve bought $4.5 trillion in MBS over a period of years while the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) injected capital directly into banks. The financial crisis eventually passed, but the total government commitment was much larger than the $700 billion figure often cited.
