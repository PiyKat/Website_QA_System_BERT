 Investing and Fundamental Analysis . If the intrinsic value is higher than the current market price the stock is deemed to be undervalued and a buy recommendation is given. If the intrinsic value is lower than its market price the stock is considered overvalued and a sell recommendation is issued. Investors go long (purchasing with the expectation that the stock will rise in price) companies that are strong, and go short (selling shares that you believe will drop in value with the expectation of repurchasing them at a lower price) companies that are weak. This method of stock analysis is considered to be the opposite of technical analysis, which forecasts the direction of prices through an analysis of historical market data such as price and volume.
