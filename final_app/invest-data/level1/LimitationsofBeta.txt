 Limitations of Beta . While beta offers useful information for stock evaluation, it does have a few shortcomings. Beta is useful in determining a security's short-term risk, and for analyzing volatility to arrive at equity costs using CAPM. However, the since beta statistic is calculated using historical data points, it becomes less meaningful for investors looking to predict a stock's future movements. Additionally, because beta relies on historical data, it doesn't factor in any new information on the market, stock or portfolio for which it's used. Beta is also less useful for long-term investments since a stock's volatility can change significantly from year to year depending upon the company's growth stage and other factors.
