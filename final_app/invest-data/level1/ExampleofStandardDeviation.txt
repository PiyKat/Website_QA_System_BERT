 Example of Standard Deviation . Say we have the data points 5, 7, 3, and 7, which total 22. You would then divide 22 by the number of data points, in this case, four—resulting in a mean of 5.5. This leads to the following determinations: x̄ = 5.5 and N = 4. The variance is determined by subtracting the value of the mean from each data point, resulting in -0.5, 1.5, -2.5 and 1.5. Each of those values is then squared, resulting in 0.25, 2.25, 6.25 and 2.25. The square values are then added together, resulting in a total of 11, which is then divided by the value of N minus 1, which is 3, resulting in a variance approximately of 3.67. The square root of the variance is then calculated, which results in a standard deviation measure of approximately 1.915. Or consider shares of Apple (AAPL) for the last five years. Returns for Apple’s stock were 37.7% for 2014, -4.6% for 2015, 10% for 2016, 46.1% for 2017 and -6.8% for 2018. The average return over the five years is 16.5%. The value of each year's return less the mean is 21.2%, -21.2%, -6.5%, 29.6%, and -23.3%. All those values are then squared to yield 449.4, 449.4, 42.3, 876.2, and 542.9, respectively. The variance is 590.1, where the squared values are added together and divided by 4 (N minus 1). The square root of the variance is taken to get the standard deviation of 24.3%.
