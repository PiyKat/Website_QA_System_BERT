 BPS and Investments . Basis points are also used when referring to the cost of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A mutual fund with an annual management expense ratio (MER) of 0.15% will be quoted as having 15 bps. When funds are compared, basis points are used to provide a clearer understanding of the difference between the cost of investment funds. For example, an analyst may state that a fund with 0.35% in expenses is 10 basis points lower than another with an annual expense of 0.45%. Since interest rates don't apply to equity, basis points are less commonly used as a terminology for price quotes in the stock market.
