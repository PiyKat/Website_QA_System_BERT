 Understanding Covariance . Covariance evaluates how the mean values of two variables move together. If stock A's return moves higher whenever stock B's return moves higher and the same relationship is found when each stock's return decreases, then these stocks are said to have positive covariance. In finance, covariances are calculated to help diversify security holdings. When an analyst has a set of data, a pair of x and y values, covariance can be calculated using five variables from that data. They are: Given this information, the formula for covariance is: Cov(x,y) = SUM [(xi - xm) * (yi - ym)] / (n - 1)
