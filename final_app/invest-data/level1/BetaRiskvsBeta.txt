 Beta Risk vs. Beta . Beta, in the context of investing, is also known as beta coefficient and is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. In short, the beta of an investment indicated whether it is more or less volatile compared to the market. It is a component of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its beta and expected market returns. As such, beta is only tangentially related to beta risk in the context of decision-making.
