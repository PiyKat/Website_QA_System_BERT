 Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Ideal for passive, buy-and-hold investors Vulnerable to market swings, crashes Lack of flexibility No human element Limited gains Lowered expense leads to better performance. Advocates argue that passive funds have been successful in outperforming most actively managed mutual funds. It is true that a majority of mutual funds fail to beat broad indexes. For example, during the five years ending December 2018, 82% of large-cap funds generated a return less than the S&P 500, according to SPIVA Scorecard data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. On the other hand, passively managed funds do not attempt to beat the market. Their strategy instead seeks to match the overall risk and return of the market—on the theory that the market always wins.
