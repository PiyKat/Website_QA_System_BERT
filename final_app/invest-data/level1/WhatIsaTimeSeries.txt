 What Is a Time Series? . A time series is a sequence of numerical data points in successive order. In investing, a time series tracks the movement of the chosen data points, such as a securityâ€™s price, over a specified period of time with data points recorded at regular intervals. There is no minimum or maximum amount of time that must be included, allowing the data to be gathered in a way that provides the information being sought by the investor or analyst examining the activity. [Important: Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time.]
