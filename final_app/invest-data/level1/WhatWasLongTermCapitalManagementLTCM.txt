 What Was Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)? . Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a large hedge fund led by Nobel Prize-winning economists and renowned Wall Street traders. The firm was wildly successful from 1994-1998, attracting more than $1 billion of investor capital with the promise of an arbitrage strategy that could take advantage of temporary changes in market behavior and, theoretically, reduce the risk level to zero. But the fund nearly collapsed the global financial system in 1998. This was due to LTCM’s highly leveraged trading strategies that failed to pan out. Ultimately, LTCM had to be bailed out by a consortium of Wall Street banks in order to prevent systemic contagion. [Fast Fact: LTCM was formed in 1993 and was founded by renowned Salomon Brothers bond trader John Meriwether along with Nobel-prize winning Myron Scholes of the Black-Scholes model.]
