 Real World Example of an Option . Suppose that Microsoft (MFST) shares are trading at $108 per share and you believe that they are going to increase in value. You decide to buy a call option to benefit from an increase in the stock's price. You purchase one call option with a strike price of $115 for one month in the future for 37 cents per contact. Your total cash outlay is $37 for the position, plus fees and commissions (0.37 x 100 = $37). If the stock rises to $116, your option will be worth $1, since you could exercise the option to acquire the stock for $115 per share and immediately resell it for $116 per share. The profit on the option position would be 170.3% since you paid 37 cents and earned $1â€”that's much higher than the 7.4% increase in the underlying stock price from $108 to $116 at the time of expiry. In other words, the profit in dollar terms would be a net of 63 cents or $63 since one option contract represents 100 shares ($1 - 0.37 x 100 = $63). If the stock fell to $100, your option would expire worthlessly, and you would be out $37 premium. The upside is that you didn't buy 100 shares at $108, which would have resulted in an $8 per share, or $800, total loss. As you can see, options can help limit your downside risk.
