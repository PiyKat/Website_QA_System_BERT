 The Bottom Line . Risk is inseparable from return. Every investment involves some degree of risk, which can be very close to zero in the case of a U.S. T-bill or very high for something such as concentrated exposure to Sri Lankan equities or real estate in Argentina. Risk is quantifiable both in absolute and in relative terms. A solid understanding of risk in its different forms can help investors to better understand the opportunities, trade-offs, and costs involved with different investment approaches.
