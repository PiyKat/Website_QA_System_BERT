 Example of Portable Alpha Strategy . A portable alpha strategy, for example, might involve investing in large-cap stocks to get the beta or market return, and investing in small-cap equities to achieve alpha. But since small caps are more volatile than large caps, the overall beta will be higher. To neutralize this higher beta, the small-cap strategy could be hedged with futures on a small-cap index, thereby returning the beta of the overall strategy, large caps, and small caps, to its original level.
