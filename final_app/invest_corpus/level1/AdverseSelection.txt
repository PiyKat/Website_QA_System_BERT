 Adverse Selection . Adverse selection describes a situation in which one party in a deal has more accurate and different information than the other party. The party with less information is at a disadvantage to the party with more information. This asymmetry causes a lack of efficiency in the price and quantity of goods and services. Most information in a market economy is transferred through prices, which means that adverse selection tends toÂ result from ineffective price signals.
