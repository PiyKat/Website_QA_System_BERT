 Understanding the Role of a Financial Planner . A financial planner must be qualified with sufficient education, training and experience in order for clients to place trust in of the financial planner's recommendations. To help convey their qualification, the practitioner may carry one or more professional designations. Understanding the Role of a Financial Planner . Financial planners explicitly providing financial advice and managing money for clients are considered fiduciaries. This means they are legally obligated to act in the client’s best interests and they can’t personally benefit from the management of client assets. They are expected to manage these assets for the client’s benefit rather than their own. Fiduciary specifics can vary. For example, registered investment advisers (RIA) are fiduciaries under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. They are regulated by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) or state securities regulators. Understanding the Role of a Financial Planner . Many RIAs are fee-only advisers, meaning they can’t work off commission or sell a client any investment products that aren’t in the client's best interests. Financial planners don’t have to be RIAs to work under this business model. Fee-only financial planners generally make their money as an hourly rate, an annual fixed retainer or as a percentage of the investment assets they manage on behalf of their clients. They also have a fiduciary duty to their clients over any broker or dealer. Understanding the Role of a Financial Planner . Financial planners working off commission generally earn money as payments from companies whose investment products they recommend. They can also earn money by opening accounts for clients.
