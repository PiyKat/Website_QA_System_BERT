 Measuring Active Risk . There are two generally accepted methodologies for calculating active risk. Depending on which method is used, active risk can be positive or negative. The first method for calculating active risk is to subtract the benchmark's return from the investment's return. For example, if a mutual fund returned 8% over the course of a year while its relevant benchmark index returned 5%, the active risk would be: Measuring Active Risk . This shows that 3% of additional return was gained from either active security selection, market timing or a combination of both. In this example, the active risk has a positive effect. However, had the investment returned less than 5%, the active risk would be negative, indicating that security selections and/or market-timing decisions that deviated from the benchmark were poor decisions. Measuring Active Risk . The second way to calculate active risk, and the one more often used, is to take the standard deviation of the difference of investment and benchmark returns over time. The formula is: Measuring Active Risk . For example, assume the following annual returns for a mutual fund and its benchmark index: Measuring Active Risk . The differences equal: Measuring Active Risk . The square root of the sum of the differences squared, divided by (N - 1) equals the active risk (where N = the number of periods):
