 What Is Beta Risk? . Beta risk is the probability that a false null hypothesis will be accepted by a statistical test. This is also known as a Type II error or consumer risk. In this context, the term "risk" refers to chance or likelihood of making an incorrect decision. The primary determinant of the amount of beta risk is the sample size used for the test. Specifically, the larger the sample tested, the lower the beta risk becomes.
