 Active Risk vs. Residual Risk . Residual risk is company-specific risks, such as strikes, outcomes of legal proceedings or natural disasters. This risk is known as diversifiable risk, since it can be eliminated by sufficiently diversifying a portfolio. There isn't a formula for calculating residual risk; instead, it must be extrapolated by subtracting the systematic risk from the total risk. Active Risk vs. Residual Risk . Active risk arises through portfolio management decisions that deviate a portfolio or investment away from its passive benchmark. Active risk comes directly from human or software decisions. Active risk is created by taking an active investment strategy instead of a completely passive one. Residual risk is inherent to every single company and is not associated with broader market movements. Active Risk vs. Residual Risk . Active risk and residual risk are fundamentally two different types of risks that can be managed or eliminated, though in different ways. To eliminate active risk, follow a purely passive investment strategy. To eliminate residual risk, invest in a sufficiently large number of different companies inside and outside of the company's industry.
