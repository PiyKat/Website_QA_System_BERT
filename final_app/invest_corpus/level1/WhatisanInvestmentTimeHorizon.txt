 What is an Investment Time Horizon? . An Investment Time Horizon, or just Time Horizon, is the period of time one expects to hold an investment until they need the money back. Time horizons are largely dictated by investment goals and strategies. For example, saving for a down payment on a house, maybe 2 years, would be considered a short-term time horizon, while saving for college a medium-term time horizon, and investing for retirement a long-term time horizon.
