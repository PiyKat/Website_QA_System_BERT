 Example of a Drawdown . Assume a trader decides to buy Apple stock at $100. The price rises to $110 (peak) but then swiftly falls to $80 (trough) and then climbs back above $110. Example of a Drawdown . Drawdowns measure peak to trough. The peak price for the stock was $110, and the trough was $80. The Drawdown is $30 / $110 = 27.3%. Example of a Drawdown . This shows that a drawdown isn't necessarily the same as a loss. The stocks drawdown was 27.3%, yet the trader would be showing an unrealized loss of 20% when the stock was at $80. This is because most traders view losses in terms of their purchase price ($100 in this case), and not the peak price the investment reached after entry. Example of a Drawdown . Continuing with the example, the price then rallies to $120 (peak) and then falls back to $105 before rallying to $125. Example of a Drawdown . The new peak is now $120 and the newest trough is $105. This is a $15 drawdown, or $15 / $120 = 12.5%.
