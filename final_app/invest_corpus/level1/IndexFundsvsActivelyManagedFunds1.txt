 Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Lowered expense leads to better performance. Advocates argue that passive funds have been successful in outperforming most actively managed mutual funds. It is true that a majority of mutual funds fail to beat broad indexes. For example, during the five years ending December 2018, 82% of large-cap funds generated a return less than the S&P 500, according to SPIVA Scorecard data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . On the other hand, passively managed funds do not attempt to beat the market. Their strategy instead seeks to match the overall risk and return of the market—on the theory that the market always wins. Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Passive management leading to positive performance tends to be true over the long term. With shorter timespans, active mutual funds do better. The SPIVA Scorecard indicates that in a span of one year, only 64% of large-cap mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500. In other words, over one-third of them beat it in the short term. Also, in other categories, actively managed money rules. As an example, nearly 85% of mid-cap mutual funds beat their S&P MidCap 400 Growth Index benchmark, in the course of a year. Index Funds vs. Actively Managed Funds . Even over the long term, when an actively managed fund is good, it is very, very good. Investor's Business Daily's "Best Mutual Funds 2019" report lists dozens of funds that have racked up a 10-year average total return of 15% to 19%, compared to the S&P 500's 13.12%. They've significantly outperformed the market in one-, three-, and five-year periods, too. Admittedly, this a feat that only 13% of the 8,000 mutual funds out there can claim, as detailed in the report.
