 Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . The formula to calculate annualized rate of return needs only two variables: the returns for a given period of time and the time the investment was held. The formula is: Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . ﻿Annualized Return=((1+r1)×(1+r2)×(1+r3)×⋯×(1+rn))1n−1\begin{aligned} \text{Annualized Return} = &\big ( (1 + r_1 ) \times (1 + r_2) \times (1 + r_3) \times \\ &\dots \times (1 + r_n) \big ) ^ \frac{1}{n} - 1 \\ \end{aligned}Annualized Return=​((1+r1​)×(1+r2​)×(1+r3​)×⋯×(1+rn​))n1​−1​﻿ Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . For example, take the annual rates of returns of Mutual Fund A above. An analyst substitutes each of the "r" variables with the appropriate return, and "n" with the number of years the investment was held. In this case, five years. The annualized return of Mutual Fund A is calculated as: Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . ﻿Annualized Return=((1+.03)×(1+.07)×(1+.05)×(1+.12)×(1+.01))15−1=1.3090.20−1=1.0553−1=.0553,or 5.53%\begin{aligned} \text{Annualized Return} &= \big ( (1 + .03) \times (1 + .07) \times (1 + .05) \times \\ &\quad \quad (1 + .12) \times (1 + .01) \big ) ^ \frac{1}{5} -1 \\ &= 1.309 ^ {0.20} - 1 \\ &= 1.0553 - 1 \\ &= .0553, \text{or } 5.53\% \\ \end{aligned}Annualized Return​=((1+.03)×(1+.07)×(1+.05)×(1+.12)×(1+.01))51​−1=1.3090.20−1=1.0553−1=.0553,or 5.53%​﻿ Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . An annualized return does not have to be limited to yearly returns. If an investor has a cumulative return for a given period, even if it is a specific number of days, an annualized performance figure can be calculated; however, the annual return formula must be slightly adjusted to: Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . ﻿Annualized Return=(1+Cumulative Return)365Days Held−1\begin{aligned} &\text{Annualized Return} = ( 1 + \text{Cumulative Return} ) ^ \frac {365}{ \text{Days Held} } - 1 \\ \end{aligned}​Annualized Return=(1+Cumulative Return)Days Held365​−1​﻿ Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . For example, assume a mutual fund was held by an investor for 575 days and earned a cumulative return of 23.74%. The annualized rate of return would be: Annualized Return Formula and Calculation . ﻿Annualized Return=(1+.2374)365575−1=1.145−1=.145,or 14.5%\begin{aligned} \text{Annualized Return} &= ( 1 + .2374) ^ \frac{365}{575} - 1 \\ &= 1.145 - 1 \\ &= .145, \text{or } 14.5\% \\ \end{aligned}Annualized Return​=(1+.2374)575365​−1=1.145−1=.145,or 14.5%​﻿
