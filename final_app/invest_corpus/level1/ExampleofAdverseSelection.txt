 Example of Adverse Selection . Life insurance premiums can be a way of looking at an example of adverse selection. Let's assume there are two sets of people in the population, those who smoke and do not exercise, and those who do not smoke and do exercise. It is common knowledge that those who smoke and don't exercise have shorter life expectancies than those who don't smoke and do exercise. Suppose there are two individuals who are looking to buy life insurance, one who smokes and does not exercise, and one who doesn't smoke and exercises daily. However, the insurance company, without further information, cannot differentiate between the individual who smokes and doesn't exercise and the other person. Example of Adverse Selection . The insurance company asks the individuals to fill out questionnaires to distinguish them. However, the individual that smokes and doesn't exercise knows that answering truthfully means higher insurance premiums, so he lies and says he doesn't smoke and exercises daily. This leads to adverse selection, where the life insurance company is at a disadvantage and then charges the same premium to both individuals. However, insurance is more valuable to the non-exercising smoker than the exercising non-smoker because one party has more to gain. The non-exercising smoker needs health insurance more and benefits from the lower premium.
