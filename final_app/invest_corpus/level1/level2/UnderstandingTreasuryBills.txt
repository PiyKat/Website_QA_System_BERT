 Understanding Treasury Bills . The U.S. government issues T-bills to fund various public projects, such as the construction of schools and highways. When an investor purchases a T-Bill, the U.S. government is effectively writing an IOU to the investor. T-bills are considered a safe and conservative investment since the U.S. government backs them. Understanding Treasury Bills . T-Bills are normally held until the maturity date. However, some holders may wish to cash out before maturity and realize the short-term interest gains by reselling the investment in the secondary market. Understanding Treasury Bills . T-bills can have maturities of just a few days or up to a maximum of 52 weeks, but common maturities are 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. The longer the maturity date, the higher the interest rate that the T-Bill will pay to the investor. Understanding Treasury Bills . T-bills are issued at a discount from the par value—or the face value—of the bill, meaning the purchase price is less than the face value of the bill. For example, a $1,000 bill might cost the investor $950 to buy the product. Understanding Treasury Bills . When the bill matures, the investor is paid the face value—par value—of the bill they bought. If the face value amount is greater than the purchase price, the difference is the interest earned for the investor. T-bills do not pay regular interest payments as with a coupon bond, but a T-Bill does include interest, reflected in the amount it pays when it matures. Understanding Treasury Bills . The interest income from T-bills is exempt from state and local income taxes. However, the interest income is subject to federal income tax.
