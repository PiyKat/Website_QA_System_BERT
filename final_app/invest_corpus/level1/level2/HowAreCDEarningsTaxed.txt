 How Are CD Earnings Taxed? . When you hold a CD, the bank will apply interest to your account at regular intervals. This is usually done either monthly or quarterly, and will show up on your statements as earned interest. Just like interest paid on a savings or money market account, it will accumulate and be reported to you in the new year as interest earned, so that you can report it as income when you file your tax return. How Are CD Earnings Taxed? . Sometimes people get confused about this because they are not able to actually withdraw and use those interest earnings. So their expectation is that they will be taxed on the earnings when they withdraw the CD funds at maturity (or sooner if they cash out early). This is incorrect. For tax-reporting purposes, your CD earnings are taxed at the time the bank applies them to your account, regardless of when you withdraw your CD funds.
