 Defaulting on a Futures Contract . Defaulting on a futures contract occurs when one party does not fulfill the obligations set forth by the agreement. Defaulting here usually involves the failure to settle the contract by the required date. A futures contract is a legal agreement for a transaction on a particular commodity or asset. One side of the contract agrees to buy at a specific date and price while the other party agrees to sell at the contract specified milestones.
