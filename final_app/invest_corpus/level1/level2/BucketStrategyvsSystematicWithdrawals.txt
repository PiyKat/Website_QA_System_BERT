 Bucket Strategy vs. Systematic Withdrawals . There are many different strategies that can be used to generate retirement income. But the big two are the systematic withdrawal approach and the bucket approach. According to a 2011 study, 75% of financial advisors frequently or always use a systematic withdrawal strategy and 38% frequently or always use a time-based segmentation approach, aka bucket strategy. (The numbers add up to more than 100% because some advisors use both approaches.)
