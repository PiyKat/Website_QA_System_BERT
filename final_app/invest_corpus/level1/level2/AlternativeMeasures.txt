 Alternative Measures . In response to concerns that the official rate does not fully convey the health of the labor market, the BLS publishes five alternative measures: U-1, U-2, U-4, U-5, and U-6. Though these are often referred to as unemployment rates (U-6, in particular, is often called the "real" unemployment rate), U-3 is technically the only unemployment rate. The others are measures of "labor underutilization."  Alternative Measures . People who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer, expressed as a percentage of the labor force. Alternative Measures . ﻿U-1=Unemployed 15+ WeeksLabor Force×100\begin{aligned} &\text{U-1} = \frac { \text{Unemployed 15+ Weeks} }{ \text{Labor Force} } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-1=Labor ForceUnemployed 15+ Weeks​×100​﻿ Alternative Measures . People who lost their jobs, or whose temporary jobs ended, as a percentage of the labor force. Alternative Measures . ﻿U-2=Job LosersLabor Force×100\begin{aligned} &\text{U-2} = \frac { \text{Job Losers} }{ \text{Labor Force} } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-2=Labor ForceJob Losers​×100​﻿  Alternative Measures . Unemployed people, plus discouraged workers, as a percentage of the labor force (plus discouraged workers). Alternative Measures . ﻿U-4=Unemployed+Discouraged WorkersLabor Force+Discouraged Workers×100\begin{aligned} &\text{U-4} = \frac { \text{Unemployed} + \text{Discouraged Workers} }{ \text{Labor Force} + \text{Discouraged Workers} } \times 100 \\ \end{aligned}​U-4=Labor Force+Discouraged WorkersUnemployed+Discouraged Workers​×100​﻿ Alternative Measures . Discouraged workers are those who are available to work and would like a job, but have given up actively looking for one. This category includes people who feel they lack the necessary qualifications or education, who believe there is no work available in their field, or who feel they are too young or old to find work. Those who feel unable to find work due to discrimination also fall under this category. Note that the denominator—normally labor force—is adjusted to include discouraged workers, who are not technically part of the labor force. Alternative Measures . Unemployed people, plus those who are marginally attached to the labor force, as a percentage of the labor force (plus the marginally attached).
