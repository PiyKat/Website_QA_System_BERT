 Protecting Proprietary Technology . Companies go to great lengths to keep their proprietary technology protected. After all, organizations spend a lot of time, effort, and money on developing the know-how for their products and services. Not taking the time to protect their interests could spell disaster for their operations. Protecting Proprietary Technology . Because it's so valuable, proprietary technology is always at risk. As mentioned above, companies can protect themselves by taking out patents and copyrights on their proprietary technology. These give the owner rights to the intellectual property and prevent others from copying the innovations. Protecting Proprietary Technology . Employees may leak or share it with others including the competition—accidentally or intentionally—or a data breach may occur, exposing trade secrets to hackers. So how do companies safeguard themselves from these unforeseeable actions? Protecting Proprietary Technology . Many corporations control and/or limit employee access to data. Employees may also be required to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), a contract that gives the employer legal recourse if internal, confidential information is shared with outside parties. Companies may also need to continuously update their security systems to ensure there is no data breach, exposing their secrets to third parties.
