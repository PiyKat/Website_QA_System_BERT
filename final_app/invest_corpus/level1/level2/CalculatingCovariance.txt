 Calculating Covariance . Calculating a stock's covariance starts with finding a list of previous prices or "historical prices" as they are called on most quote pages. Typically, you use the closing price for each day to find the return. To begin the calculations, find the closing price for both stocks and build a list. For example: Calculating Covariance . Next, we need to calculate the average return for each stock: Calculating Covariance . This is represented by the following equation: Calculating Covariance . ﻿Covariance=∑(ReturnABC − AverageABC) ∗ (ReturnXYZ − AverageXYZ)(Sample Size) − 1\text{Covariance}=\frac{\sum{\left(Return_{ABC}\text{ }-\text{ }Average_{ABC}\right)\text{ }*\text{ }\left(Return_{XYZ}\text{ }-\text{ }Average_{XYZ}\right)}}{\left(\text{Sample Size}\right)\text{ }-\text{ }1}Covariance=(Sample Size) − 1∑(ReturnABC​ − AverageABC​) ∗ (ReturnXYZ​ − AverageXYZ​)​﻿ Calculating Covariance . Using our example of ABC and XYZ above, the covariance is calculated as: Calculating Covariance . = [(1.1 - 1.30) x (3 - 3.74)] + [(1.7 - 1.30) x (4.2 - 3.74)] + [(2.1 - 1.30) x (4.9 - 3.74)] + … Calculating Covariance . = [0.148] + [0.184] + [0.928] + [0.036] + [1.364] Calculating Covariance . = 2.66 / (5 - 1) Calculating Covariance . = 0.665 Calculating Covariance . In this situation, we are using a sample, so we divide by the sample size (five) minus one. Calculating Covariance . The covariance between the two stock returns is 0.665. Because this number is positive, the stocks move in the same direction. In other words, when ABC had a high return, XYZ also had a high return.
