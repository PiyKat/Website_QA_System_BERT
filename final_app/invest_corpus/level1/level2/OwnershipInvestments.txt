 Ownership Investments . Investors who delve into ownership investments own particular assets that they expect to grow in value. Ownership investments include stocks, real estate, precious objects, and businesses. Stocks, also called equity or shares, give investors a stake in a company and its profits and gains. Real estate owned by investors can be rented or sold to provide higher net profits for the owner. Precious objects such as collectibles, art, and precious metals are considered ownership investments if they are sold for a profit. Capital used to build businesses that provide products and services for profit is another type of ownership investment.
