After the financial crisis of 2007-09, an explosion of lawsuits occurred against issuers of CMOs, CDOs and other debt securities—and among investors in the products themselves, all of which was dubbed "tranche warfare" in the press. An April 14, 2008, story in the Financial Times noted that investors in the senior tranches of failed CDOs were taking advantage of their priority status to seize control of assets and cut off payments to other debt-holders. CDO trustees, like Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo were filing suits to ensure all tranche investors continued to receive funds. Real-World Example of Tranches . And in 2009, the manager of Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund Carrington Investment Partners filed a lawsuit against the mortgage-servicing company American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc.

Carrington argued in the complaint that its interests as a junior tranche-holder were in line with those of the senior tranche-holders.
