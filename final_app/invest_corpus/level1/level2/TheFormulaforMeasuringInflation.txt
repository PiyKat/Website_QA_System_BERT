 The Formula for Measuring Inflation . The above-mentioned variants of inflation indexes can be used to calculate the value of inflation between two particular months (or years). While a lot of ready-made inflation calculators are already available on various financial portal and websites, it is always better to be aware of the underlying methodology to ensure accuracy with a clear understanding of the calculations. Mathematically, The Formula for Measuring Inflation . The rise in Inflation = (Final CPI Index Value/Initial CPI Value) The Formula for Measuring Inflation . Say you wish to know how the purchasing power of $10,000 changed between Sept. 1975 and Sept. 2018. One can find inflation index data on various portals in a tabular form. From that table, pick up the corresponding CPI figures for of the given two months. For Sept. 1975, it was 54.6 (Initial CPI value) and for Sept. 2018, it was 252.439 (Final CPI value).﻿﻿ Plugging in the formula yields: The Formula for Measuring Inflation . Rise in Inflation = (252.439/54.6) = 4.6234 = 462.34% The Formula for Measuring Inflation . Since you wish to know how much $10,000 of Sept. 1975 would be in Sept. 2018, multiply the rise in inflation factor with the amount to get the changed dollar value: The Formula for Measuring Inflation . Change in dollar value = 4.6234 * $10,000 = 46,234.25 The Formula for Measuring Inflation . To get the final dollar value of the end period, add the original dollar amount ($10,000) to the change in dollar value: The Formula for Measuring Inflation . Final dollar value = $10,000 + $46,234.25 = $56,234.25 The Formula for Measuring Inflation . This means that $10,000 in Sept. 1975 will be worth $56,234.25. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services (as included in the CPI definition) worth $10,000 in 1975, the same basket would cost you $56,234.25 in Sept. 2018.
