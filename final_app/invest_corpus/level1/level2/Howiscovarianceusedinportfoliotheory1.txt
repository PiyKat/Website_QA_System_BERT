How is covariance used in portfolio theory? . The use of covariance does have drawbacks. Covariance can only measure the directional relationship between two assets. It cannot show the strength of the relationship between assets. The correlation coefficient is a better measure of that strength. An additional drawback to the use of covariance is that the calculation is sensitive to higher volatility returns. More volatile assets include returns that are farther from the mean. These outlying returns can have an undue influence on the resulting covariance calculation. Large single-day price moves can impact the covariance, which leads to an inaccurate estimate of the measurement.
