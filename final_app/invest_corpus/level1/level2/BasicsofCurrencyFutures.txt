 Basics of Currency Futures . The first currency futures contract was created at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1972 and it is the largest market for currency futures in the world today. Currency futures contracts are marked-to-market daily. This means traders are responsible for having enough capital in their account to cover margins and losses which result after taking the position. Futures traders can exit their obligation to buy or sell the currency prior to the contract's delivery date. This is done by closing out the position. Except for contracts that involve the Mexican Peso and South African Rand, currency futures contracts are physically delivered four times in a year on the third Wednesday of March, June, September, and December.
