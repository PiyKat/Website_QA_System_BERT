 Other Policy Aspects . Reinsurance occurs when your insurer "sells" some of your coverage to another insurance company. Suppose you are a famous rock star and you want your voice to be insured for $50 million. Your offer is accepted by the Insurance Company A. However, Insurance Company A is unable to retain the entire risk, so it passes part of this risk – let's say $40 million – to Insurance Company B. Should you lose your singing voice, you will receive $50 million from insurer A ($10 million + $40 million) with insurer B contributing the reinsured amount ($40 million) to insurer A. This practice is known as reinsurance. Generally, reinsurance is practiced to a much greater extent by general insurers than life insurers.
