 Calls and Puts . There are two types of vanilla options: calls and puts. The owner of a call has the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying instrument at the strike price. The owner of a put has the right, but not the obligation, to sell the instrument at the strike price. The seller of the option is referred to as its writer. Shorting or writing an option creates an obligation to buy or sell the instrument if the option is exercised by its owner. Calls and Puts . Calls and puts both have an expiry date. This puts a time limit on how long the underlying asset has to move. Calls and Puts . For example, stock XYZ may be trading at $30. A call option that expires in one month has a strike price or $31. The cost of this option, called the premium, is $0.35. Each option contract controls 100 shares, so buying one option costs $0.35 x 100 shares, or $35. Calls and Puts . If the price of XYZ stock moves above $31, that option is in the money. But, the underlying asset needs to move above $31.35 in order for the buyer to start seeing a profit on the trade. The most the option buyer can lose is the amount they paid for the option. The profit potential is unlimited and depends on how far the underlying moves above the strike price. Calls and Puts . The option writer gets the $35 for writing the option. If the price of XYZ stock stays below $31, the writer keeps the premium. If the price rises above $31, the option writer has an obligation to sell that stock to the option buyer at $31 even if the stock rises to $35. This would represent a loss of [(($35 - $31) x 100) - $35], or $365. Then the option is said to be out of the money.
