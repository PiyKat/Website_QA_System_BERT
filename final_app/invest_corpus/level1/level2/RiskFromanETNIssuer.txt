 Risk From an ETN Issuer . The repayment of the principal invested depends, in part, on the performance of the underlying index. If the index either goes down or does not go up enough to cover the fees involved in the transaction, the investor will receive a lower amount at maturity than what was originally invested. Risk From an ETN Issuer . The ETNs ability to pay back the principal—plus gains from the index it tracks—depends on the financial viability of the issuer. As a result, an ETN's value is impacted by the credit rating of the issuer. The value of the ETN could decline due to a downgrade in the issuer's credit rating, even though there was no change in the underlying index. Risk From an ETN Issuer . Investors must be aware of the risks that the issuer of an ETN may be unable to repay the principal and default on the bond. Also, political, economic, legal, or regulatory changes may affect the financial institution's ability to pay ETN investors on time. Risk From an ETN Issuer . The financial institution issuing the ETN might use options to achieve the return from the index, which can increase the risk of losses to investors. Options are agreements that can magnify gains or losses where the issuer has the right to transact shares of stocks by paying a premium in the options market. Options are usually short-term contracts, and the premiums can fluctuate wildly based on market conditions. Risk From an ETN Issuer . Investors also have closure risk meaning the issuer might be able to close the ETN before maturity. In this case, the investor would be paid the prevailing price in the market. If the sale price is lower than the purchase price, the investor can realize a loss. The early redemption feature of an ETN is stated up front.
