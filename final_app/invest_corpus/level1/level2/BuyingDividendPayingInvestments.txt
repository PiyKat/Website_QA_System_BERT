 Buying Dividend-Paying Investments . Investors seeking dividend investments have a number of options including stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and more. The dividend discount model or the Gordon growth model can be helpful in choosing stock investments. These techniques rely on anticipated future dividend streams to value shares. Buying Dividend-Paying Investments . To compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance, investors can use the dividend yield factor which measures the dividend in terms of a percent of the current market price of the company’s share. The dividend rate can also be quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share, or DPS). In addition to dividend yield, another important performance measure to assess the returns generated from a particular investment is the total return factor which accounts for interest, dividends, and increases in share price, among other capital gains. Buying Dividend-Paying Investments . Tax is another important consideration when investing for dividend gains. Investors in high tax brackets are observed to prefer dividend-paying stocks if the jurisdiction allows zero- or comparatively lower tax on dividends than the normal rates. For example, the U.S. and Canada have a lower tax on dividend income for shareholders, while dividend gains are tax-exempt in India.
