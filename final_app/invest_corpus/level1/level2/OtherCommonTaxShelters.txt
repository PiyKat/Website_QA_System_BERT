 Other Common Tax Shelters . Certain types of assets can also be invested in to provide tax shelters. Investors with foreign investments in their portfolios can take advantage of the foreign tax credit which applies to taxpayers who pay tax on their foreign investment income to a foreign government. The credit can be used by individuals, estates, or trusts to reduce their income tax liability. Some municipal bonds are also tax-exempt, meaning that any interest income that is generated is exempt from federal income taxes, and in many cases, state and local income taxes as well. Other Common Tax Shelters . To encourage investment in companies of certain sectors (oil exploration, renewable energy, and mining, for example) which require heavy capital investment and take several years to start making profits, the government allows the exploration costs incurred by these companies to be distributed to shareholders as tax deductions. The exploration and development costs are taken as the shareholders’ expenses; shareholders deduct the expenses from their taxable income as if they directly incurred these costs. Other Common Tax Shelters . Mutual funds that invest in government or municipal bonds are also common tax shelters. Though you still pay income tax on your initial investment when those dollars are earned, the interest generated by these debt securities is exempt from federal income taxes, so your investment generates annual income tax-free.
