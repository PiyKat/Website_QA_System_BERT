 Understanding Price Levels . The price level is analyzed through a basket of goods approach, in which a collection of consumer-based goods and services is examined in aggregate. Changes in the aggregate price over time push the index measuring the basket of goods higher. Weighted averages are typically used rather than geometric means. Price levels provide a snapshot of prices at a given time, making it possible to review changes in the broad price level over time. As prices rise (inflation) or fall (deflation), consumer demand for goods is also affected. This leads to broad production measures such as gross domestic product (GDP) higher or lower. Understanding Price Levels . Price levels are one of the most watched economic indicators in the world. Economists widely believe that prices should stay relatively stable year to year so they don't cause undue inflation. If price levels rise too quickly, central bankers or governments look for ways to decrease the money supply or the aggregate demand for goods and services.
