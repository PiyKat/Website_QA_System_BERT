 Understanding Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) . 13.55 = modified duration x 1 Understanding Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) . Modified duration = 13.55 Understanding Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) . This means that if rates go down 100bp (i.e. 1%), the value of the bond will increase by 13.55% x $10,000 = $1,355. Understanding Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP) . Another way to look at this is to remember that the PVBP is the price change of a bond when there is a 1 basis point change in the yield. In this case, the PVBP is $13.55. Therefore, a change of 100 basis point in the yield will be $13.55 x 100 = $1,355.
