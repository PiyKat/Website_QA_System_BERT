 Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . MPT makes the assumption that investors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. This implies that an investor will take on more risk only if he or she is expecting more reward. Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . The expected return of the portfolio is calculated as a weighted sum of the individual assets' returns. If a portfolio contained four equally-weighted assets with expected returns of 4, 6, 10, and 14%, the portfolio's expected return would be: Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . (4% x 25%) + (6% x 25%) + (10% x 25%) + (14% x 25%) = 8.5% Portfolio Risk and Expected Return . The portfolio's risk is a complicated function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets. To calculate the risk of a four-asset portfolio, an investor needs each of the four assets' variances and six correlation values, since there are six possible two-asset combinations with four assets. Because of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or standard deviation, is lower than what would be calculated by a weighted sum.
