 What Is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)? . The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is a U.S. government agency responsible for the collection of taxes and enforcement of tax laws (such as the wash sale rule). Established in 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln, the agency operates under the authority of the United States Department of the Treasury, and its primary purpose includes the collection of individual income taxes and employment taxes. The IRS also handles corporate, gift, excise andÂ estate taxes, including mutual funds and dividends. People colloquially refer to the IRS as the "tax man."
