 Examples of Product Recalls . Tens of millions of vehicles have already been recalled in recent years over concerns that the installed Takata air bags are defective. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that long-term exposure to high heat and humidity can cause these air bags to explode when deployed. This particular recall includes the phasing and prioritizing of repairs, as all of the replacement parts could not be made available right away and certain vehicles were at much higher risk of a dangerous air bag explosion than others. Examples of Product Recalls . Back in 2009, a major salmonella outbreak from peanut butter products processed by Peanut Corp. of America reportedly killed a number of people and sickened hundreds more. Thousands of products containing potentially-tainted peanut butter sold by a large number of different companies were associated with the massive recall. Peanut Corp. went out of business shortly afterward, and the industry took a major hit as a result. Examples of Product Recalls . Later, several toy makers, including Mattel and Fisher-Price, were forced to recall millions of their children's toys back in the mid-2000s due to excessive amounts of lead in the paint of the products. These unsafe toys had been primarily manufactured in Chinese factories.
