 Example of a Mutual Fund . One of the most famous mutual funds in the investment universe is Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund (FMAGX). Established in 1963, the fund had an investment objective of capital appreciation via investment in common stocks.﻿﻿ The fund's glory days were between 1977 and 1990, when Peter Lynch served as its portfolio manager. Under Lynch's tenure, Magellan regularly posted 29% annual returns, almost double that of the S&P 500.﻿﻿ Example of a Mutual Fund . Even after Lynch left, Fidelity's performance continued strong, and assets under management (AUM) grew to nearly $110 billion in 2000, making it the largest fund in the world.﻿﻿ By 1997, the fund had become so large that Fidelity closed it to new investors and would not reopen it until 2008. Example of a Mutual Fund . As of April 2019, Fidelity Magellan has over $16 billion in assets and has been managed by Jeffrey Feingold since 2011, with Sammy Simnegar becoming a co-manager in Feb. 2019.﻿﻿ The fund's performance has pretty much tracked or slightly surpassed that of the S&P 500.
