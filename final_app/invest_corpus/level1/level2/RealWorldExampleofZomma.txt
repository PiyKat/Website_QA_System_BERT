 Real World Example of Zomma . Derivative portfolios can have very dynamic risk profiles. For instance, their risk can vary based on factors such as price fluctuations in the underlying assets, changes in interest rates, or adjustments to implied volatility. Real World Example of Zomma . In order to keep track of this ever-evolving risk profile, derivative traders use various measurements. For example, delta is a measurement of how much profit or loss will be generated as the prices of the underlying assets move up or down. However, even this seemingly straightforward concept is more nuanced than it appears. This is because the relationship between delta and the underlying asset's price movements is not linear. This gives rise to a second measure, gamma, which tracks the sensitivity of delta to those price changes. In this sense, delta is a first-order measurement, while gamma is a second-order measurement. Real World Example of Zomma . Zomma, lastly, measures the rate of change of gamma in relation to changes in implied volatility. For example, if zomma = 1.00 for an options position, then a 1% increase in volatility will also increase the gamma by 1 unit, which will, in turn, increase the delta by the amount given by the new gamma. If the zomma is high in absolute terms (either positive or negative), it will indicate that small changes in volatility could produce large changes in directional risk as the underlying price moves.
