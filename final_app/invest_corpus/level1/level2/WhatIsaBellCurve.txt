 What Is a Bell Curve? . A bell curve is the most common type of distribution for a variable and is thus considered to be a normal distribution. The term "bell curve" originates from the fact that the graph used to depict a normal distribution consists of a bell-shaped line. The highest point on the curve, or the top of the bell, represents the most probable event in a series of data, while all other possible occurrences are equally distributed around the most probable event, creating a downward-sloping line on each side of the peak.
