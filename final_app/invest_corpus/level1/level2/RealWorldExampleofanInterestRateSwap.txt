 Real World Example of an Interest Rate Swap . Suppose that PepsiCo needs to raise $75 million to acquire a competitor. In the U.S., they may be able to borrow the money with a 3.5% interest rate, but outside of the U.S., they may be able to borrow at just 3.2%. The catch is that they would need to issue the bond in a foreign currency, which is subject to fluctuation based on the home country's interest rates. Real World Example of an Interest Rate Swap . PepsiCo could enter into an interest rate swap for the duration of the bond. Under the terms of the agreement, PepsiCo would pay the counterpart a 3.2% interest rate over the life of the bond. The company would then swap $75 million for the agreed upon exchange rate when the bond matures and avoid any exposure to exchange-rate fluctuations.
