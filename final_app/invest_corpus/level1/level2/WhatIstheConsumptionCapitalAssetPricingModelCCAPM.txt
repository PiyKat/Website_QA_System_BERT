 What Is the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model – CCAPM? . The consumption capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) is an extension of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that uses a consumption beta instead of a market beta to explain expected return premiums over the risk-free rate. The beta component of both the CCAPM and CAPM formulas represents risk that cannot be diversified away. The consumption beta is based on the volatility of a given stock or portfolio. What Is the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model – CCAPM? . The CCAPM predicts that an asset's return premium is proportional to its consumption beta. The model is credited to Douglas Breeden, a finance professor at Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, and Robert Lucas, an economics professor at the University of Chicago who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1995.
