 What are Holdings . Holdings are the contents of an investment portfolio held by an individual or entity, such as a mutual fund or a pension fund. Portfolio holdings may encompass a wide range of investment products, from stocks, bonds and mutual funds to options, futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and relatively esoteric instruments such as private equity and hedge funds.
