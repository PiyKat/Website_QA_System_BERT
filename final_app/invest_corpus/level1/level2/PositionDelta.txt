 Position Delta . Position delta can be understood by reference to the idea of a hedge ratio. Essentially, delta is a hedge ratio because it tells us how many options contracts are needed to hedge a long or short position in the underlying. Position Delta . For example, if an at-the-money call option has a delta value of approximately 0.5 - which means that there is a 50% chance the option will end in the money and a 50% chance it will end out of the money - then this delta tells us that it would take two at-the-money call options to hedge one short contract of the underlying. In other words, you need two long call options to hedge one short futures contract. (Two long call options x delta of 0.5 = position delta of 1.0, which equals one short futures position). This means that a one-point rise in the S&P 500 futures (a loss of $250), which you are short, will be offset by a one-point (2 x $125 = $250) gain in the value of the two long call options. In this example, we would say that we are position-delta neutral. Position Delta . By changing the ratio of calls to a number of positions in the underlying, we can turn this position delta either positive or negative. For example, if we are bullish, we might add another long call, so we are now delta positive because our overall strategy is set to gain if the futures rise. We would have three long calls with a delta of 0.5 each, which means we have a net long position delta by 0.5. On the other hand, if we are bearish, we could reduce our long calls to just one, which we would now make us net short position delta. This means that we are net short the futures by -0.5. (Once you're comfortable with these aforementioned concepts, you can take advantage of advanced strategies, such asÂ position-delta neutral trading.)
