 Are CDs Safe? . Certificates of deposit are one of the safest savings or investment instruments available, for two reasons. First, their rate is fixed and guaranteed, so there is no risk that your CD’s return will be reduced or even fluctuate. What you signed up for is what you’ll get—it’s in your deposit agreement with the bank or credit union.  Are CDs Safe? . CD investments are also protected by the same federal insurance that covers all deposit products. The FDIC provides insurance for banks and the NCUA provides insurance for credit unions. When you open a CD with an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, up to $250,000 of your funds on deposit with that institution are protected by the U.S. government if that institution were to fail. Bank failures are exceptionally rare these days. But it’s good to know that a bank failure won’t put your funds in jeopardy. Are CDs Safe? . The key to ensuring your funds are as safe as possible is to make sure you choose an institution that carries FDIC or NCUA insurance (the vast majority do, but a small minority carry private insurance instead), and to avoid exceeding $250,000 in deposits in your name at any one institution. If you are holding more than that amount in deposits, you can maximize your coverage by spreading your funds across multiple institutions and/or more than one name (e.g., your spouse).
