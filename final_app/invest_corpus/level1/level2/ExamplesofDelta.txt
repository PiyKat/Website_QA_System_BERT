 Examples of Delta . Let's assume there is a publicly-traded corporation called BigCorp. Shares of its stock are bought and sold on a stock exchange, and there are put options and call options traded for those shares. The delta for the call option on BigCorp shares is .35. That means that a $1 change in the price of BigCorp stock generates a $.35 change in the price of BigCorp call options. Thus, if BigCorp’s shares trade at $20 and the call option trades at $2, a change in the price of BigCorp’s shares to $21 means the call option will increase to a price of $2.35. Examples of Delta . Put options work in the opposite way. If the put option on BigCorp shares has a delta of -$.65, then a $1 increase in BigCorp's share price generates a $.65 decrease in the price of BigCorp's put options. So if BigCorp’s shares trade at $20 and the put option trades at $2, then BigCorp’s shares increase to $21, and the put option will decrease to a price of $1.35.
