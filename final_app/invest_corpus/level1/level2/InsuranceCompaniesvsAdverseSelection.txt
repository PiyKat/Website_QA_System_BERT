 Insurance Companies vs. Adverse Selection . Since adverse selection exposes insurance companies to high amounts of risk for which they are not receiving appropriate compensation in the form of premiums, it is essential for insurance companies to take all the steps possible to avoid adverse selection situations.Â  Insurance Companies vs. Adverse Selection . There are three principal actions that insurance companies can take to protect themselves from adverse selection. The first is accurate identification and quantification of risk factors, such as lifestyle choices that increase or lessen an applicant's risk level. The second is to have a well-functioning system in place to verify information provided by insurance applicants. A third step is to place limits, or ceilings, on coverage, referred to in the industry as aggregate limits of liability, that put a cap on the insurance company's total financial risk exposure. Insurance companies institute standard practices and systems to implement protection from adverse selection in all three of these areas.
