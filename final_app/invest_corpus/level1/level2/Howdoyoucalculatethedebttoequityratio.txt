How do you calculate the debt-to-equity ratio? . The debt-to-equity ratio shows the proportions of equity and debt a company is using to finance its assets and it signals the extent to which shareholder's equity can fulfill obligations to creditors, in the event a business declines.How do you calculate the debt-to-equity ratio? . A low debt-to-equity ratio indicates a lower amount of financing by debt via lenders, versus funding through equity via shareholders. A higher ratio indicates that the company is getting more of its financing by borrowing money, which subjects the company to potential risk if debt levels are too high. Simply put: the more a company's operations rely on borrowed money, the greater the risk of bankruptcy, if the business hits hard times. This is because minimum payments on loans must still be paid--even if a company has not profited enough to meet its obligations. For a highly leveraged company, sustained earnings declines could lead to financial distress or bankruptcy.
