 What Is the Formula for VaR? . VaR is defined as:  What Is the Formula for VaR? . ﻿VaR=[Expected Weighted Return of the Portfolio− (z-score of the confidence interval× standard deviation of the portfolio)]× portfolio value\begin{aligned}VaR &= [\text{Expected\ Weighted\ Return\ of\ the\ Portfolio}\\&\quad -\ (z\text{-score\ of\ the\ confidence\ interval}\\&\quad\times\ \text{standard\ deviation\ of\ the\ portfolio)]}\\&\quad\times\ \text{portfolio\ value}\\\end{aligned}VaR​=[Expected Weighted Return of the Portfolio− (z-score of the confidence interval× standard deviation of the portfolio)]× portfolio value​﻿ What Is the Formula for VaR? . Typically, a timeframe is expressed in years. However, if the timeframe is being measured in weeks or days, we divide the expected return by the interval and the standard deviation by the square root of the interval. For example, if the timeframe is weekly, the respective inputs would be adjusted to (expected return ÷ 52) and (portfolio standard deviation ÷ √52). If daily, use 252 and √252, respectively.  What Is the Formula for VaR? . As with many financial applications, the formula sounds easy—it has only a few inputs—but calculating the inputs for a large portfolio is computationally intense. You must estimate the expected return for the portfolio, which can be error-prone, calculate the portfolio correlations and variance, and then plug in all the data. In other words, it is not as easy as it looks.
