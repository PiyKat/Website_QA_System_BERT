 S&P 500 ETF . The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) is a market-capitalization, weighted index of some of the largest publicly traded U.S. corporations. Most analysts see the S&P 500 as the best indicator of the U.S. equity market. This index is a commonly used benchmark for many portfolio managers, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. S&P 500 ETF . The three most commonly traded ETFs that track the performance of the S&P 500 index include: S&P 500 ETF . The common theme between all three funds is, of course, the index they track—the S&P 500. Many investors consider this index to be the pulse of the U.S. equity market. It is calculated using the market capitalizations of the 500 largest U.S. companies with stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq Stock Market. Index constituents are selected by a committee, which takes into account criteria such as market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, length of trading, and other factors. S&P 500 ETF . The oldest and the most widely held of the three ETFs is SPY. As of March 2019, the fund had a net asset value of US$262.83 billion. The fund's expenses come in at 0.09%. While this expense is negligible in a broader asset management context, it is the highest among the three competitors. Even in spite of the higher expense, the fund has superior liquidity, with an average daily trading volume of 30 to 60 times that of IVV and VOO. S&P 500 ETF . When comparing the performance numbers of the three—represented by net asset value (NAV) returns—all three slightly underperformed the S&P500 index over the last 10 years. VOO is the new kid on the block with a fund inception date of Sept. 9, 2010, so, it has fewer years of data for consideration. The SPY returned the lowest of the three funds. The lowered return is to be expected since it has the highest expense ratio among the three ETFs. Also, it must be understood that the funds are comparing to the virtually frictionless S&P 500 Index.
