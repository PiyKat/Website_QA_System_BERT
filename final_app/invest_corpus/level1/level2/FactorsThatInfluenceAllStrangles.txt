 Factors That Influence All Strangles . There are three key differences that strangles have from their straddle cousins: Factors That Influence All Strangles . The first key difference is the fact that strangles are executed using out-of-the-money (OTM) options. OTM options may be up to or even over 50% less expensive than their at-the-money (ATM) or in-the-money (ITM) option counterparts. This is of significant importance depending on the amount of capital a trader may have to work with. Factors That Influence All Strangles . If a trader has put a long strangle on, then the discount allows them to trade both sides of the fence at 50% of the costs of putting on a long straddle. If a trader is determined to put a short straddle on, then they are collecting 50% less premium while still being exposed to the problem of unlimited loss that selling options exposes a trader to. Factors That Influence All Strangles . A second key difference between a strangle and a straddle is the fact that the market may not move at all. Since the strangle involves the purchase or sale of options that are OTM, there is an exposure to the risk that there may not be enough fundamental change to the underlying asset to make the market move outside of its support and resistance range. For those traders that are long the strangle, this can be the kiss of death. For those that are short the strangle, this is the exact type of limited volatility needed in order for them to profit. Factors That Influence All Strangles . Finally, the Greek option-volatility tracker delta plays a significant role when making your strangle purchase or sale decisions. Delta is designed to show how closely an option's value changes in relation to its underlying asset. An OTM option may move 30% or $0.30 for every $1 move in the underlying asset. This can only be determined by reviewing the delta of the options you may want purchase or sell.
