 Federal Reserve Note Requirements . The U.S. Treasury has employed sophisticated tactics to ensure the authenticity and prevent the counterfeiting of its Federal Reserve notes. The US Treasury enhanced circulating notes with three types of security features: covert features, banknote equipment manufacturer features, and public features. Some public features include various watermarks, security threads, and color-shifting ink. Common to all notes is the inclusion of serial numbers and a Federal Reserve Bank identifier, as well as other features. Federal Reserve Note Requirements . Federal Reserve notes have specific identifiers that provide information about them. Each note has an eleven-digit serial number, consisting of letters and numbers (10 digits for $1 and $2 notes). The first digit identifies the series year, which is the year that the Secretary of Treasury approved a new design or the year that a new secretary's signature was used in the design. Serial numbers that end with a capital letter denote that there was a significant change in the note's design. Stars appearing at the end of the serial number, replacing the last digit, signify that it is a replacement note. Federal Reserve Note Requirements . For $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 denomination notes, there is a two or three-digit code (letter-number format) that corresponds to the Federal Reserve Bank that accounts for that note. The first digit in this code corresponds to the second digit in the serial number. For smaller denominations, such as the $1 and $2 bill, a seal identifies the Federal Reserve Bank.
