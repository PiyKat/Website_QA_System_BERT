 Understanding Gains . A gross gain refers to the positive difference between the sale price and the purchase price. A net gain takes transaction costs and other expenses into consideration. A gain may also be either realized or unrealized. A realized gain is the profit that is received when the asset is sold, and an unrealized gain, also known as a paper gain, is the increase since purchase while the asset is still owned by the buyer. Another important distinction between gains is when they are taxable or non-taxable, as taxes can have a large impact on how much of a gain actually ends up in an investor's pocket.
