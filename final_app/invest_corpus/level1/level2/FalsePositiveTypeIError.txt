 False Positive Type I Error . Sometimes, rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the test subject, the stimuli, and the outcome can be incorrect. If something other than the stimuli causes the outcome of the test, it can cause a "false positive" result where it appears the stimuli acted upon the subject, but the outcome was caused by chance. This "false positive," leading to an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis, is called a type I error. A type I error rejects an idea that should not have been rejected.
