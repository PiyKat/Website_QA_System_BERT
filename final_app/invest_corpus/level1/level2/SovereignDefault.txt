 Sovereign Default . Sovereign default or national default occurs when a country cannot repay its debts. Government bonds are issued by governments to raise money to finance projects or day-to-day operations. Government bonds are typically considered low-risk investments since the government backs them. However, the debt issued by a government is only as safe as the government's finances and ability to back it. Sovereign Default . If a country defaults on its sovereign debt or bonds, the ramifications can be severe and lead to a collapse of the country's financial markets. The economy might go into recession, or its currency might devalue. For countries, a default could mean not being able to raise funds needed for basic needs such as the food, police, or the military.
