 Share Capital . Share capital consists of all funds raised by a company in exchange for shares of either common or preferred shares of stock. The amount of share capital or equity financing a company has can change over time. A company that wishes to raise more equity can obtain authorization to issue and sell additional shares, thereby increasing its share capital. Share Capital . Share capital is only generated by the initial sale of shares by the company to investors. It does not include shares being sold in a secondary market after they've been issued.
