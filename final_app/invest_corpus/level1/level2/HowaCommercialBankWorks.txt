 How a Commercial Bank Works . The amount of money earned by a commercial bank is determined by the spread between the interest it pays on deposits and the interest it earns on loans it issues, which is known as net interest income. How a Commercial Bank Works . Customers find commercial bank investments, such as savings accounts and CDs, attractive because they are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), and money can be easily withdrawn. However, these investments traditionally pay very low interest rates compared with mutual funds and other investment products. In some cases, commercial bank deposits pay no interest, such as checking account deposits. How a Commercial Bank Works . In a fractional reserve banking system, commercial banks are permitted to create money by allowing multiple claims to assets on deposit. Banks create credit that did not previously exist when they make loans. This is sometimes called the money multiplier effect. There is a limit to the amount of credit lending institutions can create this way. Banks are legally required to keep a certain minimum percentage of all deposit claims as liquid cash. This is called the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio in the United States is 10%. This means for every $100 the bank receives in deposits, $10 must be retained by the bank and not loaned out, while the other $90 can be loaned or invested.
