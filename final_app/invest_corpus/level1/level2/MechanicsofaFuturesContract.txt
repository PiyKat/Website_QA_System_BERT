 Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Imagine an oil producer plans to produce one million barrels of oil over the next year. It will be ready for delivery in 12 months. Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Assume the current price is $75 per barrel. The producer could produce the oil, and then sell it at the current market prices one year from today. Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Given the volatility of oil prices, the market price at that time could be very different than the current price. Mechanics of a Futures Contract . If oil producer thinks oil will be higher in one year, they may opt not to lock in a price now. But, if they think $75 is a good price, they could lock-in a guaranteed sale price by entering into a futures contract. Mechanics of a Futures Contract . A mathematical model is used to price futures, which takes into account the current spot price, the risk-free rate of return, time to maturity, storage costs, dividends, dividend yields, and convenience yields. Assume that the one-year oil futures contracts are priced at $78 per barrel. By entering into this contract, in one year the producer is obligated to deliver one million barrels of oil and is guaranteed to receive $78 million. The $78 price per barrel is received regardless of where spot market prices are at the time. Mechanics of a Futures Contract . Contracts are standardized. For example, one oil contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is for 1,000 barrels of oil. Therefore, if someone wanted to lock in a price (selling or buying) on 100,000 barrels of oil, they would need to buy/sell 100 contracts. To lock in a price on one million barrels of oil/they would need to buy/sell 1,000 contracts.
