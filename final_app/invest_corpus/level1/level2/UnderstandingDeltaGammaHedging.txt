 Understanding Delta-Gamma Hedging . Both delta and gamma help to gauge movement in an optionâ€™s price relative to how in-the-money (ITM) or out-of-the-money (OTM) the option is. Traders hedge delta to limit the risk of small price movements in the underlying security, and hedge gamma to protect themselves from the remaining exposure created through the use of a delta hedge. In other words, hedging gamma should have the effect of protecting the trader's position from movement in the option's delta. Understanding Delta-Gamma Hedging . Delta moves between -1 and +1. Call options have deltas between 0 and 1, while put options have deltas between 0 and -1. When delta changes, gamma is approximately the difference between the two delta values. Further out-of-the-money options have deltas that tend toward zero. Further in-the-money options have deltas that tend toward 1 (call) or -1 (put).
