 Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions . The simplest example of a LIBOR-based transaction is a floating rate bond which pays an annual interest based on LIBOR, says at LIBOR + 0.5%. As the value of LIBOR changes, the interest payment will change. Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions . LIBOR also applies to interest rate swapsâ€”contractual agreements between two parties to exchange interest payments at a specified time. Assume Paul owns a $1 million investment that pays him a variable LIBOR-based interest rate equal to LIBOR + 1% each quarter. Since his earnings are subject to LIBOR values and are variable in nature, he wants to switch to fixed-rate interest payments. Then there is Peter, who has a similar $1 million investment which pays him a fixed interest of 1.5% per quarter. He wishes to get a variable earning, as it may occasionally give him higher payments. Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions . Both Paul and Peter can enter into a swap agreement, exchanging their respective interest receipts. Paul will receive the fixed 1.5% interest over his $1 million investment from Peter which equals $15,000, while Peter receives LIBOR + 1% variable interest from Paul. Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions . If LIBOR is 1%, then Peter will receive 2% or $20,000 from Paul. Since this figure is higher than what he owes to Paul, in net terms Peter will get $5,000 ($20,000 - $15,000) from Paul. By next quarter, if LIBOR comes down to 0.25%, Peter will be eligible to receive 1.25% or $12,500 from Paul. In net terms, Paul will get $2,500 ($15,000 - $12,500) from Peter. Examples of LIBOR-Based Products and Transactions . Such swaps essentially fulfill the requirement of both the transacting parties who wanted to change the type of interest receipts (fixed and floating).
