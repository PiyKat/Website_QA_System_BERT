 Understanding Benchmark Error . A benchmark, also called an index or proxy, is a standard against which the performance of a security, investment strategy, or investment manager can be measured. It is therefore important to select a benchmark that has a similar risk-return profile of the security, strategy, or manager in question. Otherwise, the analysis could produce conclusions that are misleading and unreliable. Understanding Benchmark Error . Today, investors have thousands of benchmarks to choose from. These include not only traditional equity and fixed income benchmarks, but also more exotic benchmarks created for hedge funds, derivatives, real estate, and other types of investments. Understanding Benchmark Error . The choice of an appropriate benchmark is important to investors and investment managers alike. Investors and managers keep a close eye on their investment portfolios and their benchmarks to see if their portfolio is performing in line with their expectations. If the portfolioâ€™s performance deviates significantly from the benchmark chosen, it may indicate that style drift has occurred. In other words, it might indicate that the portfolio has drifted away from its desired risk tolerance and investment style.
