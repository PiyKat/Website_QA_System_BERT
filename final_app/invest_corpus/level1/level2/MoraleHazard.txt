 Morale Hazard . Morale hazard is an insurance term used to describe an insured person's attitude about his or her belongings. It represents the rise of indifference to loss because the items are covered. For example, suppose a person pays insurance for his new phone. Morale hazard arises when the model of his phone becomes outdated, and he no longer cares about it. He is indifferent to his phone getting damaged because his insurance would allow him to get a new one. His indifferent attitude toward his phone leads to unconsciously changed behavior. Morale Hazard . The critical difference between moral hazard and morale hazard is the intent. Moral hazard described the intentional seeking of risk for personal gain because you do not bear the cost of failure. Morale hazard describes indifference to unintentional risk.
