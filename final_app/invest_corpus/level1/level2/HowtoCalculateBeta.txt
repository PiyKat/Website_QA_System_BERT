 How to Calculate Beta . To calculate the beta of a security, the covariance between the return of the security and the return of the market must be known, as well as the variance of the market returns. How to Calculate Beta . ﻿Beta=CovarianceVariancewhere:Covariance=Measure of a stock’s return relativeto that of the marketVariance=Measure of how the market moves relativeto its mean\begin{aligned} &\text{Beta} = \frac{ \text{Covariance} }{ \text{Variance} } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{Covariance} = \text{Measure of a stock's return relative} \\ &\text{to that of the market} \\ &\text{Variance} = \text{Measure of how the market moves relative} \\ &\text{to its mean} \\ \end{aligned}​Beta=VarianceCovariance​where:Covariance=Measure of a stock’s return relativeto that of the marketVariance=Measure of how the market moves relativeto its mean​﻿ How to Calculate Beta . Covariance measures how two stocks move together. A positive covariance means the stocks tend to move together when their prices go up or down. A negative covariance means the stocks move opposite of each other. How to Calculate Beta . Variance, on the other hand, refers to how far a stock moves relative to its mean. For example, variance is used in measuring the volatility of an individual stock's price over time. Covariance is used to measure the correlation in price moves of two different stocks.  How to Calculate Beta . The formula for calculating beta is the covariance of the return of an asset with the return of the benchmark divided by the variance of the return of the benchmark over a certain period.
