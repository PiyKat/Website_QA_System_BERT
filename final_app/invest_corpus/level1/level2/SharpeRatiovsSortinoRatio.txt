 Sharpe Ratio vs. Sortino Ratio . A variation of the Sharpe ratio is the Sortino ratio, which removes the effects of upward price movements on standard deviation to focus on the distribution of returns that are below the target or required return. The Sortino ratio also replaces the risk-free rate with the required return in the numerator of the formula, making the formula the return of the portfolio less the required return, divided by the distribution of returns below the target or required return. Sharpe Ratio vs. Sortino Ratio . Another variation of the Sharpe ratio is the Treynor Ratio that uses a portfolio’s beta or correlation the portfolio has with the rest of the market. The goal of the Treynor ratio is to determine whether an investor is being compensated for taking additional risk above the inherent risk of the market. The Treynor ratio formula is the return of the portfolio less the risk-free rate, divided by the portfolio’s beta.
