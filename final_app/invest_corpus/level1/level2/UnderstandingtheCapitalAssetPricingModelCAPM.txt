 Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . The formula for calculating the expected return of an asset given its risk is as follows: Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . ﻿ERi=Rf+βi(ERm−Rf)where:ERi=expected return of investmentRf=risk-free rateβi=beta of the investment(ERm−Rf)=market risk premium\begin{aligned} &ER_i = R_f + \beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &ER_i = \text{expected return of investment} \\ &R_f = \text{risk-free rate} \\ &\beta_i = \text{beta of the investment} \\ &(ER_m - R_f) = \text{market risk premium} \\ \end{aligned}​ERi​=Rf​+βi​(ERm​−Rf​)where:ERi​=expected return of investmentRf​=risk-free rateβi​=beta of the investment(ERm​−Rf​)=market risk premium​﻿ Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the time value of money. The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for the investor taking on additional risk. Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . The beta of a potential investment is a measure of how much risk the investment will add to a portfolio that looks like the market. If a stock is riskier than the market, it will have a beta greater than one. If a stock has a beta of less than one, the formula assumes it will reduce the risk of a portfolio. Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . A stock’s beta is then multiplied by the market risk premium, which is the return expected from the market above the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate is then added to the product of the stock’s beta and the market risk premium. The result should give an investor the required return or discount rate they can use to find the value of an asset. Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . The goal of the CAPM formula is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared to its expected return.
