 Why Investors Might Want to Limit Risk . Limited risk strategies help protect a portfolio against volatility. It can be especially attractive when an investor has experienced an extended period of gains and wants to lock in some of them. When choosing a limited risk investment, the investor is fully aware of the potential amount he or she could lose. For example, entering into a cash long position in a stock has limited risk because the investor can lose no more than the initial amount invested. Similarly, purchasing option contracts long has a limited risk, as only the initial premium paid for the option can be lost. Why Investors Might Want to Limit Risk .

However, the security that this strategy provides could make it well worth the time and effort during a period of declining stock prices.
