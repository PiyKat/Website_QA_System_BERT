 Example of Gamma . Suppose a stock is trading at $10 and its option has a delta of 0.5 and a gamma of 0.1. Then, for every 10 percent move in the stock’s price, the delta will be adjusted by a corresponding 10 percent. This means that a $1 increase will mean that the option’s delta will increase to 0.6. Likewise, a 10 percent decrease will result in corresponding decline in delta to 0.4.
