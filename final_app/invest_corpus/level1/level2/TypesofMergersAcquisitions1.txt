 Types of Mergers & Acquisitions . In a management acquisition, also known as a management-led buyout (MBO), a company's executives purchase a controlling stake in another company, making it private. These former executives often partner with a financier or former corporate officers, in an effort to help fund a transaction. Such M&A transactions are typically financed disproportionately with debt, and the majority of shareholders must approve it. For example, in 2013, Dell Corporation announced that it was acquired by its chief executive manager, Michael Dell.
