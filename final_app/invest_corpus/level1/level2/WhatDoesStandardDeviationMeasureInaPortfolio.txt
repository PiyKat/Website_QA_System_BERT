Standard deviation can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance, which itself is the average of the squared differences of the mean.What Does Standard Deviation Measure In a Portfolio? . When it comes to mutual fund or hedge fund investing, analysts look to standard deviation more than any other risk measurement. By taking the standard deviation of a portfolio's annual rate of return, analysts can better measure the consistency with which returns are generated. Mutual funds with a long track record of consistent returns display a low standard deviation. Growth-oriented orÂ emerging market funds, however, are likely to see more volatility and to have a higher standard deviation. They also, therefore, carry more risk.
