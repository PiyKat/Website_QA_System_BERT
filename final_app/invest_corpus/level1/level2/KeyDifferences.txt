 Key Differences . At first glance, the CAPM and APT formulas look identical, but the CAPM has only one factor and one beta. Conversely, the APT formula has multiple factors that include non-company factors, which requires the asset's beta in relation to each separate factor. However, the APT does not provide insight into what these factors could be, so users of the APT model must analytically determine relevant factors that might affect the asset's returns. On the other hand, the factor used in the CAPM is the difference between the expected market rate of return and the risk-free rate of return.
