 Calculating Price with the Binomial Model . The basic method of calculating the binomial option model is to use the same probability each period for success and failure until the option expires. However, a trader can incorporate different probabilities for each period based on new information obtained as time passes. Calculating Price with the Binomial Model . A binomial tree is a useful tool when pricing American options and embedded options. Its simplicity is its advantage and disadvantage at the same time. The tree is easy to model out mechanically, but the problem lies in the possible values the underlying asset can take in one period time. In a binomial tree model, the underlying asset can only be worth exactly one of two possible values, which is not realistic, as assets can be worth any number of values within any given range. Calculating Price with the Binomial Model . For example, there may be a 50/50 chance that the underlying asset price can increase or decrease by 30 percent in one period. For the second period, however, the probability that the underlying asset price will increase may grow to 70/30. Calculating Price with the Binomial Model . For example, if an investor is evaluating an oil well, that investor is not sure what the value of that oil well is, but there is a 50/50 chance that the price will go up. If oil prices go up in Period 1 making the oil well more valuable and the market fundamentals now point to continued increases in oil prices, the probability of further appreciation in price may now be 70 percent. The binomial model allows for this flexibility; the Black-Scholes model does not.
