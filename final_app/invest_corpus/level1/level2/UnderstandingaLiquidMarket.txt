 Understanding a Liquid Market . Liquid markets are usually found in financial assets such as forex, futures, bonds and stocks. Markets for high-priced tangible goods, such as luxury items, heavy industrial equipment or houses are considered illiquid markets. But even financial securities can also be thinly traded depending on a number of factors including the time of day, the immediate conditions of a given market, or the relative visibility of the asset. Understanding a Liquid Market . The market for the stock of a Fortune 500 company would be considered a liquid market, but the market for a family-owned restaurant would not. The largest and most liquid market in the world is the forex market, where foreign currencies are traded. It is estimated that the daily trading volume in the currency market is over $5 trillion, which is dominated by the U.S. dollar. The markets for the euro, yen, pound, franc and Canadian dollar are also highly liquid. Understanding a Liquid Market . Futures markets that trade on the major currencies and major stock market indexes are very liquid, but futures markets that trade specialized grain or metals products may be much more thinly traded.
