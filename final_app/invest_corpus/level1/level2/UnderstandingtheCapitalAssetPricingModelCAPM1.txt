 Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . For example, imagine an investor is contemplating a stock worth $100 per share today that pays a 3% annual dividend. The stock has a beta compared to the market of 1.3, which means it is riskier than a market portfolio. Also, assume that the risk-free rate is 3% and this investor expects the market to rise in value by 8% per year. Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . The expected return of the stock based on the CAPM formula is 9.5%: Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . ﻿9.5%=3%+1.3×(8%−3%)\begin{aligned} &9.5\% = 3\% + 1.3 \times ( 8\% - 3\% ) \\ \end{aligned}​9.5%=3%+1.3×(8%−3%)​﻿ Understanding the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) . The expected return of the CAPM formula is used to discount the expected dividends and capital appreciation of the stock over the expected holding period. If the discounted value of those future cash flows is equal to $100 then the CAPM formula indicates the stock is fairly valued relative to risk.
