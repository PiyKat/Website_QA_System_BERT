 Congress Shares Some Blame . Many members of the U.S. Congress were strong supporters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Despite warnings and red flags raised by critics, they continued to allow the companies to increase in size. Fannie and Freddie were encouraged to purchase an increasing number of lower credit quality loans to help the disadvantaged and support the market. Wall Street would probably have introduced innovative mortgage products even in the absence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On the other hand, it might be concluded that Wall Street's expansion into exotic mortgages was motivated by the need to compete with Fannie and Freddie. Wall Street was looking for a way to cope with the implicit guarantee given to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the U.S. Congress. Congress Shares Some Blame . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created an enormous amount of debt and credit guarantees in the years leading up to 2007. Congress should have recognized the systematic risks to the global financial system that these firms posed. They should have considered the risks to U.S. taxpayers, who would eventually foot the bill for a government bailout.
