 Authorized Participants . Exchange-traded fund issuers use creation units for new share issuance through broker-dealers. They also have relationships with broker-dealer trading desks, which act as authorized participants. Authorized participants are unique to open-end ETFs and serve to monitor significant deviation from a fundâ€™s NAV in the trading market. Since ETFs trade actively throughout the day on financial market exchanges, they offer premiums and discounts to their accounting NAV. Authorized participants follow this market mechanism and help manage premium and discount to NAV trading.
