 Understanding Proprietary Technology . Proprietary technology involves an application, tool, or system that belongs exclusively to an enterprise. These are generally developed and used by the owner internally in order to produce and sell products or services to the end user or customer. In other cases, they may be provided to an end-user or customer for a cost. Understanding Proprietary Technology . In some industries, proprietary technologies are a key determinant of success. As a result, they are confidential. Being carefully guarded within a corporation, they are protected legally by patents and copyrights. For many businesses, particularly in knowledge-based industries, intellectual property can make up a majority of assets on an entityâ€™s balance sheet. For these businesses, investors and interested parties go to great lengths to assess and value proprietary technologies and their contribution to business results.
