 Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services, it is subject to inflation. Rising prices will tend to increase GDP and falling prices will make GDP look smaller, without necessarily reflecting any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced. Thus, just by looking at an economy’s un-adjusted GDP, it is difficult to tell whether the GDP went up as a result of production expanding in the economy or because prices rose. Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . That’s why economists have come up with an adjustment for inflation to arrive at an economy’s real GDP. By adjusting the output in any given year for the price levels that prevailed in a reference year, called the base year, economists adjust for inflation's impact. This way, it is possible to compare a country’s GDP from one year to another and see if there is any real growth. Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Real GDP is calculated using a GDP price deflator, which is the difference in prices between the current year and the base year. For example, if prices rose by 5% since the base year, the deflator would be 1.05. Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator, yielding real GDP. Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP because inflation is typically a positive number. Real GDP accounts for the change in market value, which narrows the difference between output figures from year to year. A large discrepancy between a nation's real and nominal GDP signifies significant inflation (if the nominal is higher) or deflation (if the real is higher) in its economy. Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Nominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used because, by removing the effects of inflation, the comparison of the different years focuses solely on volume.
