People who are marginally attached to the labor force include discouraged workers and anyone else who would like a job and has looked for one in the past 12 months but have given up actively searching. As with U-4, the denominator is expanded to include the marginally attached, who are not technically part of the labor force. Alternative Measures . Unemployed people, plus people who are marginally attached to the labor force, plus those who are employed part-time for economic reasons, as a percentage of the labor force (plus marginally attached).

This metric is the BLS' most comprehensive. In addition to the categories included in U-5, it accounts for people who have been forced to settle for part-time work even though they want to work full-time. This category is often referred to as "underemployed," although that label arguably includes full-time workers who are overqualified for their jobs. The denominator for this ratio is the same as in U-5.
