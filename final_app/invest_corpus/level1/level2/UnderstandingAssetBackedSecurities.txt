 Understanding Asset-Backed Securities . Asset-backed securities allow issuers to generate more cash, which, in turn, is used for more lending, while giving investors the opportunity to invest in a wide variety of income-generating assets. Usually, the underlying assets of an ABS are illiquid and can't be sold on their own. However, pooling the assets together and creating a financial security, a process called securitization, enables the owner of the assets to make them marketable. The underlying assets of these pools may be home equity loans, automobile loans, credit card receivables, student loans,Â or other expected cash flows. Issuers of ABS can be as creative as they desire. For example, ABS have been created based on cash flows from movie revenues, royalty payments, aircraft leases, and solar photovoltaics. Just about any cash-producing situation can be securitized into an ABS.
