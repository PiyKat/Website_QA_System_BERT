 Defaulting on Unsecured Debt . A default can also occur on unsecured debt such as medical bills and credit card debts. With unsecured debt, no assets are securing the debt, but the lender still has legal recourse in the event of default. Credit card companies often give a few months before an account goes into default. However, if after six months or more, there have been no payments, the account would get charged off meaning the lender would take a loss on the account. The bank would likely sell the charged-off account to a collection agency and the borrower would need to repay the agency. If no payments are made to the collection agency, a legal action might be taken in the form of a lien or judgment placed on the borrower's assets. A judgment lien is a court ruling that gives creditors the right to take possession of borrowers property if they fail to fulfill their contractual obligations.
