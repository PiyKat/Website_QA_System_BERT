 Closing a European Option Early . Typically, exercising an option means initializing the rights of the option so that a trade is executed at the strike price. However, many investors don't like to wait for a European option to expire. Instead, investors can sell the option contract back to the market before its expiration. Closing a European Option Early . Option prices change based on the movement and volatility of the underlying asset and the time until expiration. As a stock price rises and falls, the value—signified by the premium—of the option increases and decreases. Investors can unwind their option position early if the current option premium is higher than the premium they initially paid. The investor would receive the net difference between the two premiums. Closing a European Option Early . Closing the option position, before expiration means the trader realizes any gains or losses on the contract itself. An existing call option could be sold early if the stock has risen significantly while a put option could be sold if the stock's price has fallen. Closing a European Option Early . Closing the European option early depends on the prevailing market conditions, the value of the premium—its intrinsic value—and the option's time value. The amount of time remaining before a contract's expiration is the time value. The intrinsic value is an assumed price based on if the contract is in-, out-, or at-the-money. It is the difference between the stated strike price and the market price of the underlying asset. If an option is close to its expiration, it's unlikely an investor will get much return for selling the option early, because there's little time left for the option to make money. In this case, the option's worth rests on its intrinsic value.
