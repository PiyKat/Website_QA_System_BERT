 Modified Duration . The modified duration of a bond helps investors understand how much a bond's price will rise or fall if the YTM rises or falls by 1%. This is an important number if an investor is worried that interest rates will be changing in the short term. The modified duration of a bond with semi-annual coupon payments can be found with the following formula: Modified Duration . ﻿ModD=Macaulay Duration1+(YTM2)ModD=\frac{\text{Macaulay Duration}}{1+\left(\frac{YTM}{2}\right)}ModD=1+(2YTM​)Macaulay Duration​﻿ Modified Duration . Using the numbers from the previous example, you can use the modified duration formula to find how much the bond's value will change for a 1% shift in interest rates, as shown below: Modified Duration . ﻿$2.61⎵ModD=2.6841+(YTM2)\underbrace{\$2.61}_{ModD}=\frac{2.684}{1+\left(\frac{YTM}{2}\right)}ModD$2.61​​=1+(2YTM​)2.684​﻿ Modified Duration . In this case, if the YTM increases from 6% to 7% because interest rates are rising, the bond's value should fall by $2.61. Similarly, the bond's price should rise by $2.61 if the YTM falls from 6% to 5%. Unfortunately, as the YTM changes, the rate of change in the price will also increase or decrease. The acceleration of a bond's price change as interest rates rise and fall is called "convexity."
