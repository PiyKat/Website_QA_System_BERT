 Basics of Cash Settlement . Futures and options contracts are derivative instruments that have values based on an underlying asset. The asset can be an equity or a commodity. When a futures contract or options contract is expired or exercised, the conceptual recourse is for the holder of the contract to deliver the physical commodity or transfer the actual shares of stock. This is known as physical delivery and is much more cumbersome than a cash settlement. Basics of Cash Settlement . If an investor goes short on a futures contract for $10,000 worth of silver, for example, it is inconvenient at the end of the contract for the holder to physically deliver the silver to another investor. To circumvent this, futures and options contracts can be conducted with a cash settlement, where, at the end of the contract, the holder of the position is either credited or debited the difference between the initial price and the final settlement. This is also very true among traders and speculators in agricultural futures and options markets who trade things like cattle and other livestock. These traders are not farmers or meat processors and only care about the market price. So, they do not wish to take delivery of a herd of live animals. Basics of Cash Settlement . There are a couple of advantages to cash settlements. First, they reduce overall time and costs required during a contract's finalization. Cash-settled contracts are relatively simple to deliver because they require only transfer of money. An actual physical delivery has additional costs tacked onto it, such as transportation costs and costs associated with ensuring delivery quality and verification. Second, cash-settled accounts are also safeguards against a default. This is because cash settlement requires margin accounts, which are monitored daily, to ensure that they have the required balances to conduct a trade.
