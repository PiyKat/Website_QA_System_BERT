 NAV and Trade Timelines . It is important to note that while NAV is computed and reported as of a particular business date, all of the buys and sell orders for mutual funds are processed based on the cutoff time at the NAV of the trade date. For instance, if the regulators mandate a cutoff time of 1:30 p.m., then buy and sell orders received before 1:30 p.m. will be executed at the NAV of that particular date. Any orders received after the cutoff time will be processed based on the NAV of the next business day.
