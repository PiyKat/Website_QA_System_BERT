 Why Volatility Is Important to Investors . Volatility in a stock has a bad connotation, but many traders and investors seek out higher volatility investments in order to make higher profits. After all, if a stock or other security does not move, it has low volatility, but it also has a low potential to make capital gains. On the other hand, a stock or other security with a very high volatility level can have tremendous profit potential, but the risk of loss is quite high. Timing of any trades must be perfect, and even a correct market call could end up losing money if the security's wide price swings trigger a stop-loss or margin call.
