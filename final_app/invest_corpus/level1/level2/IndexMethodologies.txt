 Index Methodologies . Each individual index has its own method for calculating the indexâ€™s value. Weighted average mathematics is primarily the basis for index calculations as values are derived from a weighted average calculation of the value of the total portfolio. As such, price-weighted indexes will be more greatly impacted by changes in holdings with the highest price, market cap weighted indexes will be most greatly impacted by changes in the largest stocks, and so on depending on the weighting characteristics.
