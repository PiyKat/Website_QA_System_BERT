 Simple Delta . Let's review some basic concepts before jumping right into position delta. Delta is one of four major risk measures used by option traders. Delta measures the degree to which an option is exposed to shifts in the price of the underlying asset (i.e. stock) or commodity (i.e. futures contract). Values range from 1.0 to –1.0 (or 100 to –100, depending on the convention employed). For example, if you buy a call or a put option that is just out of the money (i.e. the strike price of the option is above the price of the underlying if the option is a call, and below the price of the underlying if the option is a put), then the option will always have a delta value that is somewhere between 1.0 and –1.0. Generally speaking, an at-the-money option usually has a delta at approximately 0.5 or -0.5. Simple Delta . Figure 1: The four dimensions of risk - AKA, the "Greeks." Simple Delta . Figure 2 contains some hypothetical values for S&P 500 call options that are at, out and in the money (in all these cases, we will be using long options). Call delta values range from 0 to 1.0, while put delta values range from 0 to –1.0. As you can see, the at-the-money call option (strike price at 900) in figure 2 has a 0.5 delta, while the out-of-the-money (strike price at 950) call option has a 0.25 delta, and the in-the-money (strike at 850) has a delta value of 0.75.  Simple Delta .
