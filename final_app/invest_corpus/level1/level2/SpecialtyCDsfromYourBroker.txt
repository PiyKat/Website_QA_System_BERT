 Specialty CDs from Your Broker . Besides the standard brokered CD, there are two kinds of specialty CDs that are generally found only through brokerage firms: Specialty CDs from Your Broker . A callable certificate is a specialized CD, on which the issuing bank retains the right to recall the CD at any time. So while you hope to be locked into a certain interest rate for a certain number of years, at any point the bank can decide to end that arrangement and return your funds to you. While this won’t result in any penalties or losses for you, it can cause you to lose the opportunity of a favorable rate that was locked in for the future. For this privilege, the bank generally pays a somewhat higher interest rate. If this is a risk you want to avoid, then search your brokerage firm’s listing for “non-callable CDs”.

These CDs carry a face value, much like a savings bond does, and are sold for some lower initial price. The most important thing to know about zero coupon CDs is that you will be taxed on the earned interest every year, even though you will not realize the certificate’s gain until it matures. So careful tax planning is recommended.
