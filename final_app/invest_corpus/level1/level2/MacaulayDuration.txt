 Macaulay Duration . Macaulay duration finds the present value of a bond's future coupon payments and maturity value. Fortunately for investors, this measure is a standard data point in most bond searching and analysis software tools. Because Macaulay duration is a partial function of the time to maturity, the greater the duration, the greater the interest-rate risk or reward for bond prices. Macaulay Duration . Macaulay duration can be calculated manually as follows: Macaulay Duration . ﻿MacD=∑f=1nCFf(1+yk)f×tfPVwhere:f=cash flow numberCF=cash flow amounty=yield to maturityk=compounding periods per yeartf=time in years until cash flow is received\begin{aligned}&MacD=\sum^n_{f=1}\frac{CF_f}{\left(1+\frac{y}{k}\right)^f}\times\frac{t_f}{PV}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&f = \text{cash flow number}\\&CF = \text{cash flow amount}\\&y = \text{yield to maturity}\\&k = \text{compounding periods per year}\\&t_f = \text{time in years until cash flow is received}\\&PV = \text{present value of all cash flows}\end{aligned}​MacD=f=1∑n​(1+ky​)fCFf​​×PVtf​​where:f=cash flow numberCF=cash flow amounty=yield to maturityk=compounding periods per yeartf​=time in years until cash flow is received​﻿ Macaulay Duration . The previous formula is divided into two sections. The first part is used to find the present value of all future bond cash flows. The second part finds the weighted average time until those cash flows are paid. When these sections are put together, they tell an investor the weighted average amount of time to receive the bond's cash flows.
