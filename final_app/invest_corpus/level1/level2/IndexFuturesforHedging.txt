 Index Futures for Hedging .  Portfolio managers will often buy equity index futures as a hedge against potential losses. If the manager has positions in a large number of stocks, index futures can help hedge the risk of declining stock prices by selling equity index futures. Since many stocks tend to move in the same general direction, the portfolio manager could sell or short an index futures contract in case stocks prices decline. In the event of a market downturn, the stocks within the portfolio would fall in value, but the sold index futures contracts would gain in value offsetting the losses from the stocks. Index Futures for Hedging . The fund manager could hedge all of the downside risks of the portfolio, or only partially offset it. The downside of hedging is that hedging can reduce profits if the hedge isn't required. For example, if in the above scenario, the portfolio manager shorts the index futures and the market rises, the index futures would decline in value. The losses from the hedge would offset gains in the portfolio as the stock market rises.
