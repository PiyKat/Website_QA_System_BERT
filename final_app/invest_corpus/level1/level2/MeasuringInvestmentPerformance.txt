 Measuring Investment Performance . Fund investors often try to assess the performance of a mutual fund based on their NAV differentials between two dates. For instance, one may likely compare the NAV on January 1 to the NAV on December 31, and see the difference in the two values as a gauge to fund’s performance. However, changes in NAV between two dates aren’t the best representations of mutual fund performance. Measuring Investment Performance . Mutual funds usually pay out virtually all of their income (like dividends and interest earned) to its shareholders. Additionally, mutual funds are also obligated to distribute the accumulated realized capital gains to the shareholders. A capital gain occurs on any security that is sold for a price higher than the purchase price that was paid for it. Since these two components, income and gains, are regularly paid out, the NAV decreases accordingly. Therefore, through a mutual fund investor gains such intermediate income and returns, they are not reflected in the absolute NAV values when compared between two dates. Measuring Investment Performance . One of the best possible measures of mutual fund performance is the annual total return, which is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period. Investors and analysts also look at compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), which represents the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year provided all intermediate payments for income and gains are accounted for.
