 What is a Redemption Mechanism . A redemption mechanism refers to how market makers of exchange traded funds (ETF) help to reconcile the differences between net asset value (NAV) and market values when shares of the ETFs trade at discounts or premiums to their NAV. ETF authorized participants use the advantages that they have through the redemption process to move ETF market prices.
