 Recovery from the Great Recession . The aggressive monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other central banks in reaction to the Great Recession, although not without criticism, are widely credited with preventing even greater damage to the global economy. Recovery from the Great Recession . For example, the Fed lowered a key interest rate to nearly zero to promote liquidity and, in an unprecedented move, provided banks with a staggering $7.7 trillion of emergency loans, according to The Week, in a policy known as quantitative easing. Along with the inundation of liquidity by the Fed, the U.S. Federal government embarked on a massive program of fiscal policy to try to stimulate the economy in the form of the $787 billion in deficit spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Recovery from the Great Recession . Not only did the government introduce stimulus packages into the financial system, but new financial regulation was also put into place. According to some economists, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act—the depression-era regulation—in the 1990s helped cause the recession. The repeal of the regulation allowed some of the United States' larger banks to merge and form larger institutions. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act to give the government expanded regulatory power over the financial sector.
