 Standard Deviation vs. Average Deviation Differences . Standard deviation is often used in creating strategies for investing and trading because it can help measure market volatility and predict performance trends. For example, an index fund should have a low average deviation when compared to its benchmark fund. That means it's closely tracking the benchmark, as it's supposed to do. More aggressive funds have a high standard deviation and greater volatility. These funds are high risk and potentially more profitable. Standard Deviation vs. Average Deviation Differences . The mean average, or absolute deviation,Â is used less frequently because the use of absolute values makes further calculations more complicated and unwieldy than using the standard deviation.
