 Real World Examples of Put Options . Assume an investor owns one put option on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)—currently trading at $277.00—with a strike price of $260 expiring in one month. For this option they paid a premium of $0.72, or $72 ($0.72 x 100 shares). Real World Examples of Put Options . The investor has the right to sell 100 shares of XYZ at a price of $260 until the expiration date in one month, which is usually the third Friday of the month, though it can be weekly. Real World Examples of Put Options . If shares of SPY fall to $250 and the investor exercises the option, the investor could purchase 100 shares of SPY for $250 in the market and sell the shares to the option's writer for $260 each. Consequently, the investor would make $1,000 (100 x ($260-$250)) on the put option, less the $72 cost they paid for the option. Net profit is $1,000 - $72 = $928, less any commission costs. The maximum loss on the trade is limited to the premium paid, or $72. The maximum profit is attained if SPY falls to $0. Real World Examples of Put Options . Contrary to a long put option, a short or written put option obligates an investor to take delivery, or purchase shares, of the underlying stock. Real World Examples of Put Options . Assume an investor is bullish on SPY, which is currently trading at $277, and does not believe it will fall below $260 over the next two months. The investor could collect a premium of $0.72 (x 100 shares) by writing one put option on SPY with a strike price of $260. Real World Examples of Put Options . The option writer would collect a total of $72 ($0.72 x 100). If SPY stays above the $260 strike price, the investor would keep the premium collected since the options would expire out of the money and be worthless. This is the maximum profit on the trade: $72, or the premium collected.
