 Z-Score . The Z-score, or standard score, is the number of standard deviations a given data point lies above or below the mean. The mean is the average of all values in a group, added together, and then divided by the total number of items in the group. Z-Score . To calculate Z-score, subtract the mean from each of the individual data points and divide the result by the standard deviation. Results of zero show the point and the mean equal. A result of one indicates the point is one standard deviation above the mean and when data points are below the mean, the Z-score is negative. Z-Score . In most large data sets, 99% of values have a Z-score between -3 and 3, meaning they lie within three standard deviations above or below the mean. Z-Score . Z-scores offer analysts a way to compare data against a norm. A given company’s financial information is more meaningful when you know how it compares to that of other, comparable companies. Z-score results of zero indicate that the data point being analyzed is exactly average, situated among the norm. A score of 1 indicates that the data are one standard deviation from the mean, while a Z-score of -1 places the data one standard deviation below the mean. The higher the Z-score, the further from the norm the data can be considered the be. Z-Score . In investing, when the Z-score is higher it indicates that the expected returns will be volatile, or are likely to be different from what is expected. Z-Score . Bollinger Bands® is a technical indicator used by traders and analysts to assess market volatility based on standard deviation. Simply put, they are a visual representation of the Z-score. For any given price, the number of standard deviations from the mean is reflected by the number of Bollinger Bands between the price and the exponential moving average (EMA).
