 Example of Monte Carlo Simulations: The Asset Price Modeling . The frequencies of different outcomes generated by this simulation will form a normal distribution, that is, a bell curve. The most likely return is at the middle of the curve, meaning there is an equal chance that the actual return will be higher or lower than that value. The probability that the actual return will be within one standard deviation of the most probable ("expected") rate is 68%; that it will be within two standard deviations is 95%; and that it will be within three standard deviations is 99.7%. Still, there is no guarantee that the most expected outcome will occur, or that actual movements will not exceed the wildest projections. Example of Monte Carlo Simulations: The Asset Price Modeling . Crucially, Monte Carlo simulations ignore everything that is not built into the price movement (macro trends, company leadership, hype, cyclical factors); in other words, they assume perfectly efficient markets. For example, the fact that Time Warner lowered its guidance for the year on November 4 is not reflected here, except in the price movement for that day, the last value in the data; if that fact were accounted for, the bulk of simulations would probably not predict a modest rise in price.
