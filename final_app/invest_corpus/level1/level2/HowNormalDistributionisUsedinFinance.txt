 How Normal Distribution is Used in Finance . The assumption of a normal distribution is applied to asset prices as well as price action. Traders may plot price points over time to fit recent price action into a normal distribution. The further price action moves from the mean, in this case, the more likelihood that an asset is being over or undervalued. Traders can use the standard deviations to suggest potential trades. This type of trading is generally done on very short time frames as larger timescales make it much harder to pick entry and exit points. How Normal Distribution is Used in Finance . Similarly, many statistical theories attempt to model asset prices under the assumption that they follow a normal distribution. In reality, price distributions tend to have fat tails, and, therefore, have kurtosis greater than three. Such assets have had price movements greater than three standard deviations beyond the mean more often than would be expected under the assumption of a normal distribution. Even if an asset has went through a long period where it fits a normal distribution, there is no guarantee that the past performance truly informs the future prospects.
