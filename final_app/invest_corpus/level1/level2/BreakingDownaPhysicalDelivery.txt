 Breaking Down a Physical Delivery . Derivatives contracts are either cash-settled or physically delivered on the expiry date of the contract. When a contract is cash-settled, the net cash position of the contract on the expiry date is transferred between the buyer and the seller. For example, assume two parties enter into an E-mini S&P 500 futures contract to be settled in six months for $2,770 (the futures price). If the value of the index on the day the contract expires is higher than the futures price, the buyer gains; otherwise, the seller profits. The difference between the spot price of the contract as of the settlement date and the futures price agreed on will be credited or debited from the accounts of both parties. Say, the closing value of the index six months from now is $2,900, the long futures holder’s account will be credited ($2,900 - $2,770) x $50 = 130 x 50 = $6,500. This amount will be debited from the account of the party shorting the position. [Note that $50 x S&P 500 index represents 1 contract unit for E-mini S&P 500 futures contract]. Breaking Down a Physical Delivery . With a physical delivery, the underlying asset of the option or derivatives contract is physically delivered on a predetermined delivery date. Let’s look at an example of physical delivery. Assume two parties enter into a one-year (March 2019) Crude Oil futures contract at a futures price of $58.40. Regardless of the commodity’s spot price on the settlement date, the buyer is obligated to purchase 1,000 barrels of crude oil (unit for 1 crude oil futures contract) from the seller. If the spot price on the agreed settlement day sometime in March is below $58.40, the long contract holder loses and the short position gains. If the spot price is above the futures price of $58.40, the long position profits, and the seller records a loss.
