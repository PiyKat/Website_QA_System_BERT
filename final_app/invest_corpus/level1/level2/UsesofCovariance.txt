 Uses of Covariance . Finding that two stocks have a high or low covariance might not be a useful metric on its own. Covariance can tell how the stocks move together, but to determine the strength of the relationship, we need to look at their correlation. The correlation should, therefore, be used in conjunction with the covariance, and is represented by this equation: Uses of Covariance . ﻿Correlation=ρ=cov(X,Y)σXσYwhere:cov(X,Y)=Covariance between X and YσX=Standard deviation of XσY=Standard deviation of Y\begin{aligned} &\text{Correlation}=\rho=\frac{cov\left(X, Y\right)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &cov\left(X, Y\right)=\text{Covariance between X and Y}\\ &\sigma_X=\text{Standard deviation of X}\\ &\sigma_Y=\text{Standard deviation of Y}\\ \end{aligned}​Correlation=ρ=σX​σY​cov(X,Y)​where:cov(X,Y)=Covariance between X and YσX​=Standard deviation of XσY​=Standard deviation of Y​﻿ Uses of Covariance . The equation above reveals that the correlation between two variables is the covariance between both variables divided by the product of the standard deviation of the variables. While both measures reveal whether two variables are positively or inversely related, the correlation provides additional information by determining the degree to which both variables move together. The correlation will always have a measurement value between -1 and 1, and it adds a strength value on how the stocks move together. Uses of Covariance . If the correlation is 1, they move perfectly together, and if the correlation is -1, the stocks move perfectly in opposite directions. If the correlation is 0, then the two stocks move in random directions from each other. In short, covariance tells you that two variables change the same way while correlation reveals how a change in one variable affects a change in the other.  Uses of Covariance . You also may use covariance to find the standard deviation of a multi-stock portfolio. The standard deviation is the accepted calculation for risk, which is extremely important when selecting stocks. Most investors would want to select stocks that move in opposite directions because the risk will be lower, although they'll provide the same amount of potential return.
