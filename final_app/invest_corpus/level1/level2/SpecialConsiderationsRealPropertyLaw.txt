 Special Considerations: Real Property Law . Every U.S. state, except Louisiana, has specific real property laws governing real property and the estates they include. These laws apply to land, as well as anything that is fixed to the land, such as buildings or attached equipment. In some states, whatever lies under a plot of land is part of that real property. In other states, whatever lies beneath, or passes through, a property may be subject to different laws, with separate ownership. This could include ore, precious gems, metals, and even water. Special Considerations: Real Property Law . To be legitimate, a claim to any real property must be accompanied by a verifiable and legal property description. Such a description usually makes use of natural or manmade boundaries, such as seacoasts, rivers, streams, the crests of ridges, lakeshores, highways, or purpose-built markers such as cairns, surveyor's posts, fences, and official government surveying marks.
