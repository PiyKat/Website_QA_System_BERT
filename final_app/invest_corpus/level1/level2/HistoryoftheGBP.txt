 History of the GBP . The British pound became the official currency of the United Kingdom when England and Scotland united to form a single country in 1707. However, the British pound was first created as a form of money in the year 760. The British pound is the oldest currency in the world that is still used as legal tender. History of the GBP . In addition to the United Kingdom, the British pound has previously served as currency in many of the colonies of the British Empire, including Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Prior to 1855, when it began printing British pound notes, the Bank of England wrote all notes by hand. History of the GBP . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries enacted measures to tie the value of their currencies to the price of gold. The gold standard offered a uniform way to determine value among world currencies. Prior to World War I, the United Kingdom used the gold standard to set the value of the British pound. At the outbreak of World War I, the country abandoned the gold standard, then reinstated it in post-war 1925, only to abandon it again during the Great Depression. History of the GBP . In 1971, the United Kingdom let the British pound float freely against other currencies. This decision allowed market forces, rather than artificial pegs, to determine the value of the currency. In 1990, the U.K. considered tying the value of the British pound to the Deutsche Mark but abandoned this idea shortly thereafter. In 2002, when the euro became the common currency of most European Union member nations, the U.K. chose not to adopt it, but instead kept the GBP as its official currency. In a June 2016 referendum, British voters, by a slim majority, supported a measure to leave the European Union altogether, initiating a process that's commonly known as Brexit.
