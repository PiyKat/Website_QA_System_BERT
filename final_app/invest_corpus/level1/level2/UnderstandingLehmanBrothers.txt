 Understanding Lehman Brothers . Lehman Brothers were once considered one of the major players in the global banking and financial services industries. It saw its start in Montgomery Ala., in 1850 as a dry-goods store and quickly grew into cotton and other commodities trading. Its operations shifted to New York in 1858 when the city became home to cotton and other commodity trading. Over the next century and a half, the company underwent numerous changes and engaged in several alliances and partnerships. While the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers did not cause the Great Recession or even the subprime mortgage crisis, its downfall triggered a massive selloff in the global markets.
