 Check the Fundamentals . Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before taking chances on any penny stock. For example, it might have looked like a good bet to invest in the ailing Walter Energy Co. After all, Walter Energy had traded as high as $143.76 a share in 2011. But those who bought Walter Energy when it fell to $0.16 would have still been burned as the company soon declared bankruptcy. On the other hand, an investment in Inovio Inc. (INO), which was trading below $1 in 2008 gave investors a number of opportunities to get out above $10 in 2009 and 2013 through 2016. Check the Fundamentals . The stark contrast between these two stocks lies in company fundamentals. Walter was an established company in metallurgical coal, an aging sector prey to cyclical demand and political pressures. When world leaders made commitments to lowering greenhouse emissions, this put more downward pressure on Walter Energy, which already was reeling from a worldwide coal supply glut and slowing demand from China. Check the Fundamentals . Walter, which currently trades on the over-the-counter boards, vowed to emerge debt-free by February 2016. As of 2018, the the OTC shares of the company trade near $0.01. Check the Fundamentals . By contrast, Inovio is a speculative biotechnology play with strong partnerships in its cancer vaccine portfolio, which offers strong buyout potential. As of 2018 a buyout hasn't happened, but the stock continues to sell off and then have huge upside moves which quickly dissipate. Check the Fundamentals . So when researching penny stocks, you should carefully weigh any potential gains versus fundamental factors underlying the company: its debt, cash flow, buyout potential, and Porter’s Five Forces of Competition among others. You should have the complete picture as to why the stock's trading at its current price before you even think of buying it.
