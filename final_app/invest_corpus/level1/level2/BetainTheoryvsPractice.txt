 Beta in Theory vs. Practice . The beta coefficient theory assumes that stock returns are normally distributed from a statistical perspective. However, financial markets are prone to large surprises, so in reality, returns aren’t always normally distributed. Therefore, what beta might predict for a stock’s movement isn’t always true. Beta in Theory vs. Practice . A stock with a very low beta could have smaller price swings and yet still be in a long-term downtrend. In this case, adding a down trending stock with a low beta only decreases risk in a portfolio if you define risk as strictly volatility, rather than the potential for losses. From a practical perspective, a low beta stock in a downtrend isn’t likely to improve a portfolio’s performance. Beta in Theory vs. Practice . Similarly, a high beta stock that is volatile in a mostly upward direction will increase the risk of a portfolio but add gains as well. Investors using beta to evaluate a stock will also need to evaluate it from other perspectives—such as fundamental or technical factors—before assuming it will add or remove risk from a portfolio.
