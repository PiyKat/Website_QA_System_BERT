 Fiduciary Risk . The possibility of a trustee/agent who is not optimally performing in the beneficiary's best interests is referred to as "fiduciary risk." This does not necessarily mean that the trustee is using the beneficiary's resources for his/her own benefit; this could be the risk that the trustee is not achieving the best value for the beneficiary. Fiduciary Risk . For example, a situation where a fund manager (agent) is making more trades than necessary for a client's portfolio is a source of fiduciary risk because the fund manager is slowly eroding the client's gains by incurring higher transaction costs than are needed. Fiduciary Risk . In contrast, a situation in which an individual or entity who is legally appointed to manage another party's assets uses their power in an unethical or illegal fashion to benefit financially, or serve their self-interest in some other way, is called "fiduciary abuse" or "fiduciary fraud."
