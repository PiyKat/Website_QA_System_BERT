 Relating Standard Deviation to Risk . In investing, standard deviation is used as an indicator of market volatility and, therefore, of risk. The more unpredictable the price action and the wider the range, the greater the risk. Range-bound securities, or those that do not stray far from their means, are not considered a great risk. That's because it can be assumed—with relative certainty—that they continue to behave in the same way. A security with a very large trading range and a tendency to spike, reverse suddenly, or gap is much riskier, which can mean a larger loss. But remember, risk is not necessarily a bad thing in the investment world. The riskier the security, the greater potential it has for payout.
