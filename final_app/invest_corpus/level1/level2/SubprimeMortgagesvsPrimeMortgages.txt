 Subprime Mortgages vs. Prime Mortgages . Mortgage applicants are typically graded from A to F, with A scores going to those with exemplary credit and F scores going to those with no discernible ability to repay a loan at all. Prime mortgages go to A and B candidates, whereas C, D and F candidates must typically resign themselves to subprime loans if they're going to get loans at all.
