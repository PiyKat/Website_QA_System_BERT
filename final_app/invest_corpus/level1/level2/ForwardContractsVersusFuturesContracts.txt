 Forward Contracts Versus Futures Contracts . Both forward and futures contracts involve the agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a set price in the future. But there are slight differences between the two. While a forward contract does not trade on an exchange, a futures contract does. Settlement for the forward contract takes place at the end of the contract, while the futures contract p&l settles on a daily basis. Most importantly, futures contracts exist as standardized contracts that are not customized between counterparties.
