 The Great Recession . In the late 2000s, during the throes of a deep global recession, years of risky investing, accounting blunders, and inefficient operations left many giant U.S. corporations, all of which employed thousands of workers and contributed billions of dollars to the country's economy, on the verge of collapse. Bear Stearns, American International Group (AIG), General Motors, and Chrysler topped this list of struggling corporations. While many executives blamed the economic malaise for the woes of their businesses, the truth was that the recession only brought to light the risky behaviors in which they had already been engaging. Ultimately, the U.S. government deemed these companies too big to fail and came to their rescue in the form of a bailout costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars; its reasoning was that allowing businesses so important to the country's economy to fail would push the U.S. into a depression from which it might not recover. The Great Recession . The bailouts of AIG, General Motors, and others at taxpayers' expense presented a huge moral hazard, as it sent a message to executives at large corporations that any fallout from engaging in excessive risk to increase profits would be shouldered by someone other than themselves. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 attempted to mitigate some of the moral hazard inherent in too-big-to-fail corporations by forcing them to draw up concrete plans in advance for how to proceed if they got into financial trouble and stipulating that, going forward, companies would not be bailed out at the expense of taxpayers.
