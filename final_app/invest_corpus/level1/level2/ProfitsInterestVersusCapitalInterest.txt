 Profits Interest Versus Capital Interest . Equity in an LLC that is taxed as a partnership may be treated either as a capital interest or profits interest. A capital interest is an interest based on the current value of a company. For example, if the company were to liquidate soon after the grantÂ of capital interest was made, then the grantee would be entitled to a share of the proceeds from the liquidation. Profits Interest Versus Capital Interest . Meanwhile, a profits interest is treated as a right to share in the future growth of a company or, put another way, value created after the profits interest was granted. This differs from existing LLC equity holders whose stake is based on the current value of the entity. If the entity were to shut down, the existing LLC equity holders would share in the value of the LLC while the profits interest holder would get nothing.
