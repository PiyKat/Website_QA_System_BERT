 Understanding Zomma . Understanding zomma can be quite difficult for those who are not experienced in the jargon of derivatives. This is because zomma can only be defined in relation to two other abstract concepts: gamma and delta. In order to understand the "real world" meaning of zomma, you therefore need to understand gamma and delta as well. Understanding Zomma . With that in mind, we can begin by stating that zomma is a third-order derivative. What this means is that zomma measures the change of a second-order derivativeâ€”specifically, gamma. Gamma, in turn, measures the sensitivity of delta to changes in the price of the underlying asset. Lastly, delta measures the sensitivity of change between the underlying asset and the derivative product. Understanding Zomma . Derivative traders and portfolio managers often use zomma to determine the effectiveness of a gamma hedged portfolio. In this context, zomma would measure fluctuations in the volatility and/or the underlying assets of that portfolio.
