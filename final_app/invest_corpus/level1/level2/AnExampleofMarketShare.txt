 An Example of Market Share . All multinational companies measure success based on the market share of specific markets. China has been an important market for companies, as it is still a fast-growing market for many products. Apple Inc., for example, uses its market share numbers in China as a key performance indicator for the growth of its business. An Example of Market Share . Apple's market share for China's smartphone market fell from 13.6% at the end of 2015 to 9.6% for 2016 despite the overall Chinese smartphone market growing by 9% in 2016. Apple sales were down in China that year as it failed to launch a new iPhone, and then it further lost market share as a number of mid-range smartphones were launched by Chinese competitors OPPO and Vivo.
