 Real World Example of Derivatives . Many derivative instruments are leveraged. That means a small amount of capital is required to have an interest in a large amount of value in the underlying asset. Real World Example of Derivatives . For example, an investor who expects the S&P 500 Index to rise in value could buy a futures contract based on that venerable equity index of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies. The notional value of a futures contract on the S&P 500 is $250,000. However, as of April 2019, the exchange where the S&P500 option trades—the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)—only requires $31,500 in a margin balance to maintain a long position in it. Real World Example of Derivatives . This gives the futures investor a leverage ratio of approximately 8:1. The required margin to hold a futures or derivative position changes depending on market conditions and broker requirements.
