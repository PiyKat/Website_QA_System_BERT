 The Basics of the Black Scholes Model . The model assumes the price of heavily traded assets follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility. When applied to a stock option, the model incorporates the constant price variation of the stock, the time value of money, the option's strike price, and the time to the option's expiry. The Basics of the Black Scholes Model . Also called Black-Scholes-Merton, it was the first widely used model for option pricing. It's used to calculate the theoretical value of options using current stock prices, expected dividends, the option's strike price, expected interest rates, time to expiration and expected volatility.  The Basics of the Black Scholes Model . The formula, developed by three economists—Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton—is perhaps the world's most well-known options pricing model. It was introduced in their 1973 paper, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities," published in the Journal of Political Economy. Black passed away two years before Scholes and Merton were awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics for their work in finding a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Nobel Prize is not given posthumously; however, the Nobel committee acknowledged Black's role in the Black-Scholes model).  The Basics of the Black Scholes Model . The Black-Scholes model makes certain assumptions: The Basics of the Black Scholes Model . While the original Black-Scholes model didn't consider the effects of dividends paid during the life of the option, the model is frequently adapted to account for dividends by determining the ex-dividend date value of the underlying stock.
