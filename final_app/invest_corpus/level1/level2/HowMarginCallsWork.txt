 How Margin Calls Work . A margin call arises when an investor borrows money from a broker to make investments. When an investor uses margin to buy or sell securities, he pays for them using a combination of his own funds and borrowed money from a broker. An investor's equity in the investment is equal to the market value of securities minus borrowed funds from the broker. How Margin Calls Work . A margin call is triggered when the investor's equity, as a percentage of the total market value of securities, falls below a certain percentage requirement, which is called the maintenance margin. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and FINRA require investors to keep at least 25% of the total value of their securities as margin. Many brokerage firms may require a higher maintenance requirement—as much as 30% to 40%. How Margin Calls Work . Obviously, the figures and prices with margin calls depend on the percent of the margin maintenance and the equities involved. But in individual instances, the exact stock price below which a margin call will be triggered can be calculated. Basically, it will occur when the account value, or account equity, equals the maintenance margin requirement (MMR). The formula would be expressed as: How Margin Calls Work . Account Value = (Margin Loan) / (1-MMR)  How Margin Calls Work . Let’s say you open a margin account with $5,000 of your own money and $5,000 borrowed from your brokerage firm as a margin loan. You purchase 200 shares of a marginable stock at a price of $50 (under the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation T, you can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price). Assume that your broker's maintenance margin requirement is 30%. How Margin Calls Work . Your account has $10,000 worth of stock in it. In this example, a margin call will be triggered when the account value falls below $7,142.86 (i.e. margin loan of $5,000 / (1 – 0.30), which equates to a stock price of $35.71 per share.
