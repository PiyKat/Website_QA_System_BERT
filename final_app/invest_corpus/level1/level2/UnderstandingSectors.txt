 Understanding Sectors . Almost all economies are comprised of four, high-level sectors, which, in turn, are each made up of smaller sectors. Of the large sectors within an economy, the first group is called the primary sector and involves companies that participate in the extraction and harvesting of natural products from the earth, such as agriculture, mining and forestry. The secondary sector consists of processing, manufacturing and construction companies. The tertiary sector is comprised of companies that provide services, such as retailers, entertainment firms and financial organizations. The quaternary sector includes companies in the intellectual pursuits, such as educational businesses. Understanding Sectors . Investors use sectors to place stocks and other investments into categories such as technology, healthcare, energy, utilities and telecommunications. Each sector has unique characteristics and a different risk profile that attracts a specific type of investor. As a result, it is common for analysts and other investment professionals to specialize in certain sectors. For example, at large research firms, analysts may cover just one sector, such as pharmaceutical companies or technology stocks. Additionally, investment funds often specialize in a particular economic sector, a practice known as sector investing. For example, the oil and gas sector is a large industry that attracts specialized investment funds. Momentum in these sectors is measured using The Stochastic Oscillator and the Stochastic Momentum Index.
