 Foreign Currency Exchange and Foreign Currency Derivatives . Foreign exchange derivatives like forwards and options have two notional values. Since these transactions involve two currencies, they both receive separate notional values. For example, if at the time of a trade the exchange rate between the British pound (GBP) and the US dollar (USD) is 1.5, then $1,000,000 USD is equivalent to 666,667 GBP.
