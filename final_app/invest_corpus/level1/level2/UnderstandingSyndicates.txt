 Understanding Syndicates . In many cases, businesses that set up a syndicate operate in the same industry—several financial services or media companies will band together to form a syndicate. A separate entity is created to apply their expertise to a product or service. Syndicates are generally considered a partnership or corporation for tax purposes. Understanding Syndicates . Companies may form a syndicate for a specific business venture if it promises the potential for an attractive rate of return. The amount of risk taken on by each syndicate member can also vary. For instance, an undivided account in an investment banking syndicate means each underwriter in the syndicate is responsible for selling an allotted amount of stock along with any excess shares not sold by the syndicate as a whole. An individual member may have to sell far more securities than allotted. Other syndicates limit the amount of risk for each member. Understanding Syndicates . Some projects are so large that no single company has all of the expertise needed to efficiently complete the project. This is often the case with large construction projects such as a stadium, highway, or railroad project. In situations like these, companies may form a syndicate that allows each firm to apply its specific area of expertise to the project.
