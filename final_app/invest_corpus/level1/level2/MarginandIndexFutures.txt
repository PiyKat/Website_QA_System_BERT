Margin and Index Futures . Both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) require a minimum of 25% of the total trade value as the minimum account balance. However, some brokerages will demand greater than this 25% margin. Also, as the value of the trade climbs before expiration the broker can demand additional funds be deposited to top-off the value of the account—known as a margin call. Margin and Index Futures .

Futures differ from an option in that a futures contract is considered an obligation, while an option is considered a right that the holder may or may not exercise.
