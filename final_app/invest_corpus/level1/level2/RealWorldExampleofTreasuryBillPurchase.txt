 Real-World Example of Treasury Bill Purchase . As an example, let's say an investor purchases a par value of $1,000 T-Bill with a competitive bid of $950. When the T-Bill matures, the investor is paid $1,000, thereby earning $50 in interest on the investment.

Real-World Example of Treasury Bill Purchase . As stated earlier, the Treasury Department auctions new T-bills throughout the year. On March 28, 2019, the Treasury issued a 52-week T-bill at a discounted price of $97.613778 to a $100 face value. In other words, it would cost approximately $970 for a $1,000 T-bill.
