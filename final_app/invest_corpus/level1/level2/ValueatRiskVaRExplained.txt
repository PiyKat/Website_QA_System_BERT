 Value at Risk (VaR) Explained . The VaR measurement shows a normal distribution of past losses. The measure is often applied to an investment portfolio for which the calculation gives a confidence interval about the likelihood of exceeding a certain loss threshold. That data is used by investors to make decisions and set strategy. Stated simply, the VaR is a probability-based estimate of the minimum loss in dollar terms expected over a period.
