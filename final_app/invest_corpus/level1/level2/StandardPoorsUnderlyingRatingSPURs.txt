 Standard & Poor's Underlying Rating (SPURs) . Standard & Poor's Underlying Ratings (SPURs) provide an opinion on a municipality's credit quality separate from guarantor or insurer credit enhancements. Municipal or other public sector bonds typically include credit enhancement which is used to obtain better terms by providing increased assurance that the borrower will honor its obligation through additional insurance or a third-party guarantee. Standard & Poor's issues a SPURs rating only at the request of the issuer/obligor and maintains surveillance of an issue with a published SPUR.
