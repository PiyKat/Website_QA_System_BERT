 Basics of a Dividend . A dividend is a token reward paid to the shareholders for their investment in a company’s equity, and it usually originates from the company's net profits. While the major portion of the profits is kept within the company as retained earnings, which represent the money to be used for the company’s ongoing and future business activities, the remainder can be allocated to the shareholders as a dividend. However, at times, companies may still make dividend payments even when they don’t make suitable profits. They may do so to maintain their established track record of making regular dividend payments. Basics of a Dividend . The board of directors can choose to issue dividends over various time frames and with different payout rates. Dividends can be paid at a scheduled frequency, like monthly, quarterly or annually. For example, Walmart Inc. (WMT) and Unilever PLC ADR (UL) make regular quarterly dividend payments. Additionally, companies can also issue non-recurring special dividends either individually or in addition to a scheduled dividend. Backed by strong business performance and an improved financial outlook, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) declared a special dividend of $3.00 per share in 2004, which was way above the usual quarterly dividends in the range of 8 to 16 cents per share.
