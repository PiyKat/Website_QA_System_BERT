 Equity Options . Notional value in an option refers to the value that the option controls. Equity Options . For example, ABC is trading for $20 with a particular ABC call option costing $1.50. One equity option controls 100 underlying shares. A trader purchases the option for $1.50 x 100 = $150. Equity Options . The notional value of the option is $20 x 100 = $2,000. Buying the stock option contract would potentially give the trader control over a hundred shares of stock for $150 compared to if theyÂ purchased the stocks outright for $2,000. Equity Options . The notional value of an equity options contract is the value of the shares that are controlled rather than the cost of the transaction.
