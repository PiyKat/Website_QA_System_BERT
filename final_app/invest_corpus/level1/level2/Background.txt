 Background . Moody's dates back to "Moody's Manual," which was first published in 1900; it provided general information and statistics about stocks and bonds. In 1909, "Moody's Analyses of Railroad Investments" added analytic information about debt instruments. Moody's Investor Services was established in 1914 and built on that foundation. It was bought by credit reporting company Dun & Bradstreet in 1962 but was spun off in 2000; it has been an independent company since. Background . In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made Moody's a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization, along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Many institutions require a certain level of credit rating from an NRSRO entity in order to buy a given issue; the rating also impacts the capital requirements that the Securities and Exchange Commission applies to banks in the United States.
