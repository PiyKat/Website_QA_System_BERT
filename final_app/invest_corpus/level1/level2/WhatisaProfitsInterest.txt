 What is a Profits Interest? . Profits interest refers to an equity right based on the future value of a partnership awarded to an individual for their service to the partnership. The award consists of receiving a percentage of profits from a partnership without having to contribute capital. In effect, it is a form of equity compensation and is used as a means of incentivizing workers when monetary compensation may be difficult due to limited funds, such as with a start-up limited liability company (LLC).
