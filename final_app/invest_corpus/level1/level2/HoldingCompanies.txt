 Holding Companies . Holding companies are a closely related concept. In some cases, investors may choose to own their holdings through a limited liability company (LLC). They may do so to reduce their personal exposure to risk, minimize their taxes or pool their investments with other people, such as business associates or family members. Typically, a holding company does not engage in business directly but only serves as an ownership vehicle of other companies or investments. Holding Companies . A very famous example of such a company is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the Omaha, Nebraska company that Warren Buffett controls and manages. Berkshire Hathaway started as a textile manufacturing company, but for several decades, it has only been a holding company that Buffett uses to acquire, hold and sell various investments in other companies. Some of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings include the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), Dairy Queen Inc. and the Coca-Cola Company.
