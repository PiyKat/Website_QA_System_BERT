 Exchange-Traded Notes Explained . An ETN is typically issued by financial institutions and bases its return on a market index. ETNs are a type of bond. At maturity, the ETN will pay the return of the index it tracks. However, ETNs do not pay any interest payments like a bond. Exchange-Traded Notes Explained . When the ETN matures, the financial institution takes out fees, then gives the investor cash based on the performance of the underlying index. Since ETNs trade on major exchanges like stocks, investors can buy and sell ETNs and make money from the difference between the purchase and sale prices minus any fees. Exchange-Traded Notes Explained . ETNs are different than exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs own the securities in the index they track. For example, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 will own all 500 stocks in the S&P. Exchange-Traded Notes Explained . ETNs do not provide investors ownership of the securities but are merely paid the return that the index produces. As a result, ETNs are similar to debt securities. The investors must trust that the issuer will make good on the return based on the underlying index. Exchange-Traded Notes Explained . ETNs were first issued by Barclays Bank PLC. Banks and other financial institutions typically issue ETNs at $50 per share. Part of the market price depends on how the underlying index is performing.
