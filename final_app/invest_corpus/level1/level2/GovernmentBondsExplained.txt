 Government Bonds Explained . Government bonds are issued by governments to raise money to finance projects or day-to-day operations. The U.S. Treasury Department sells the issued bonds during auctions throughout the year. Some Treasury bonds trade in the secondary market. Individual investors, working with a financial institution or broker, can buy and sell previously issued bonds through this marketplace. Treasuries are widely available for purchase through the U.S. Treasury, brokers as well as exchange-traded funds, which contain a basket of securities. Government Bonds Explained .

If a fixed-rate government bond pays 2% per year, for example, and prices in the economy rise by 1.5%, the investor is only earning .5% in real terms.
