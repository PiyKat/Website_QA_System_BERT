 The Line of Best Fit Equation . The line of best fit determined from the least squares method has an equation that tells the story of the relationship between the data points. Line of best fit equations may be determined by computer software models, which include a summary of outputs for analysis, where the coefficients and summary outputs explain the dependence of the variables being tested.
