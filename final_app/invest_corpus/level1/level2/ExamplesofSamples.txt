 Examples of Samples . As of 2017, the population of the world was 7.5 billion, out of which 49.6% were female and 50.4% were male. The total number of people in any given country can also be a population size. The total number of students in a city can be taken as a population, and the total number of dogs in a city is also a population size. Samples can be taken from these populations for research purposes. Examples of Samples . Following our CFA exam example, the researchers could take a sample of 1,000 CFA participants from the total 200,000 test-takers—the population—and run the required data on this number. The mean of this sample would be taken to estimate the average of CFA exam takers that passed even though they only studied for less than 40 hours. Examples of Samples . The sample group taken should not be biased. This means that if the sample mean of the 1,000 CFA exam participants is 50, the population mean of the 200,000 test-takers should also be approximately 50.
