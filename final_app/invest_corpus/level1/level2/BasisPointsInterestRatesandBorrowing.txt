 Basis Points, Interest Rates and Borrowing . Borrowing rates for individuals closely follow bank-lending rates, which in turn reflect rates set by central banks. Here's how. Often banks borrow from each other the money that they lend out to clients. The interbank rate is the rate of interest charged on short-term loans made between institutions. Basis Points, Interest Rates and Borrowing . These short-term loans are of one week or less. Some, made to meet reserve requirements, are just for one day—literally overnight—and these loans are made at a rate known as the overnight rate or (in the U.S.) the federal funds rate. Basis Points, Interest Rates and Borrowing . The fed funds rate, as it's colloquially known, is one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy. Lenders derive their prime interest rate, the rate they charge their most creditworthy borrowers, from it. The terms for other consumer loans or investment instruments, like CDs, are then based on this prime rate: You've probably seen an interest rate advertised as "prime plus 3%!" or "two points above prime!" So the fed funds rate ends up influencing short-term interest rates for everything from home and auto loans to credit cards' APRs. Longer-term rates reflect it too, albeit indirectly.
