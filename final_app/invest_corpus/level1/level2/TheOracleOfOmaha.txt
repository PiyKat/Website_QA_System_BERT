The Oracle Of Omaha . The Oracle of Omaha is a nickname for Warren Buffett, who is arguably one of the greatest investors of all time. He is called The Oracle of OmahaÂ because the investment community very closely follows his investment picks and comments on the market, and he lives and works in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a company that he became the controlling shareholder of in the mid-1960s.
