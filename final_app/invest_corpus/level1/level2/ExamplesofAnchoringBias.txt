 Examples of Anchoring Bias  . It is easy to find examples of anchoring bias in everyday life. Customers for a product or service are typically anchored to a sales price based on the price marked by a shop or suggested by a salesperson. Any further negotiation for the product is in relation to that figure, regardless of its actual cost. Examples of Anchoring Bias  . Within the investing world, anchoring bias can take on several forms. Examples of Anchoring Bias  . In one instance, traders are typically anchored to the price at which they bought a security. For example, if a trader bought stock ABC for $100, then she will be psychologically fixated on that price for a sale or further purchases of the same stock, regardless of ABC's actual value based on an assessment of relevant factors affecting it. Examples of Anchoring Bias  . In another, analysts may become anchored to the value of a given index at a certain level instead of considering historical figures. For example, if the S&P 500 is on a bull run and has a value of 10,000, then analyst propensity will be to predict values closer to that figure rather than considering standard deviation of values, which have a fairly wide range for that index.
