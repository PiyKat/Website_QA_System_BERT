 BREAKING DOWN Creation Unit . Creation units are central to the process an exchange-traded fund issuer undergoes when providing new ETF shares to the market. ETF issuers work with ETF distributors to issue new shares in creation units to broker-dealers. Creation units can vary in size, with most containing between 25,000 and 600,000 ETF shares each. BREAKING DOWN Creation Unit . Creation units are sold to broker-dealers who can pay for the shares in various forms. Shares are valued at the fund’s net asset value (NAV). Exchange-traded fund issuers can negotiate with broker-dealers on the terms of the sale, typically receiving cash or in-kind shares for the transaction. In-kind shares are a common way to pay for the shares in a creation unit. In-kind share transactions require the buyer to assemble a portfolio of securities which are then transferred to the issuing company. Creation unit sales can generate profits and losses for the broker-dealer prior to exchange listing. Profits and losses can have tax implications. Thus, broker-dealers have considerable risks when buying new creation units.
