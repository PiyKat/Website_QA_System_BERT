How Can Derivatives Be Used for Risk Management? . Derivatives are financial instruments that have values derived from other assets like stocks, bonds, or foreign exchange. Derivatives are sometimes used to hedge a position (protecting against the risk of an adverse move in an asset) or to speculate on future moves in the underlying instrument. Hedging is a form of risk management that is common in the stock market, where investors use derivatives called put options to protect shares or even entire portfolios.
