 Calculating Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is calculated by first subtracting the mean from each value, and then squaring, adding, and averaging the differences to produce the variance. While variance itself is a useful indicator of range and volatility, the squaring of the individual differences means they are no longer reported in the same unit of measurement as the original data set. Calculating Standard Deviation . For stock prices, the original data is in dollars and variance is in dollars squared, which is not a useful unit of measure. Standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance, bringing it back to the original unit of measure and making it much simpler to use and interpret.
