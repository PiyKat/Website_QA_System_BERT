Homeowners with large amounts of equity do not walk away from their mortgages because they have too much to lose. This is the model upon which homeowners, mortgage originators, Wall Street, credit rating agencies, and investors built the mortgage bonanza. Prices collapsed when the housing bubble burst, so many homeowners saw their equity wiped out.

In 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began to experience large losses on their retained portfolios, especially on their Alt-A and subprime investments. In 2008, the sheer size of their retained portfolios and mortgage guarantees led the FHFA to conclude that they would soon be insolvent. On March 19, federal regulators allowed the two firms to take on another $200 billion in debt in the hopes of stabilizing the economy. By September 6, 2008, it was clear that the market believed the firms were in financial trouble, and the FHFA put the companies into conservatorship. American taxpayers were left on the hook for future losses.
