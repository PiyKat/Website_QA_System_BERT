 Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP . Overall, real GDP is a much better index for expressing long-term national economic performance. Take for example a hypothetical country which in the year 2009 had a nominal GDP of $100 billion, which grew to $150 billion by 2019 its nominal GDP. Over the same period of time, prices rose by 100%. Looking at merely nominal GDP, the economy appears to be performing well, whereas the real GDP expressed in 2009 dollars would be $75 billion, revealing that in fact, an overall decline in real economic performance occurred.
