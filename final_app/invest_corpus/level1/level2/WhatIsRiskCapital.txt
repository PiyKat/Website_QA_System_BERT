 What Is Risk Capital? . Risk capital refers to funds allocated to speculative activity and used for high-risk, high-reward investments. Diversification is key for successful investment of risk capital, as the prospects of each investment tends to be uncertain by nature although the returns can be far above average when an investment succeeds. Moreover, an investor needs to ensure that only a portion of total capital is considered risk capital. In the context of venture capital, risk capital may also refer to funds invested in a promising, but unproven, startup.
