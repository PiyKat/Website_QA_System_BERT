 Measuring Accounting Liquidity . Generally, in using these formulas, a ratio greater than one is desirable. Measuring Accounting Liquidity . The current ratio is the simplest and least strict. It measures current assets (those that can reasonably be converted to cash in one year) against current liabilities. Its formula would be: Measuring Accounting Liquidity . Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities Measuring Accounting Liquidity . The acid-test or quick ratio is slightly more strict. It excludes inventories and other current assets, which are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. As a formula: Measuring Accounting Liquidity . Acid-Test Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents + Short-Term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities Measuring Accounting Liquidity . A variation of the acid-test ratio simply subtracts inventory from current assets, making it a bit more generous: Measuring Accounting Liquidity . Acid-Test Ratio (Var) = (Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid Costs) / Current Liabilities Measuring Accounting Liquidity . The cash ratio is the most exacting of the liquidity ratios. Excluding accounts receivable, as well as inventories and other current assets, it defines liquid assets strictly as cash or cash equivalents. More than the current ratio or acid-test ratio, it assesses an entity's ability to stay solvent in the case of an emergency—the worst-case scenario—on the grounds that even highly profitable companies can run into trouble if they do not have the liquidity to react to unforeseen events. Its formula: Measuring Accounting Liquidity . Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents + Short-Term Investments) / Current Liabilities
