 RoR vs. CAGR . A closely related concept to the simple rate of return is the compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. The CAGR is the mean annual rate of return of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year, which means the calculation must factor in growth over multiple periods. RoR vs. CAGR . To calculate compound annual growth rate, we divide the value of an investment at the end of the period in question by its value at the beginning of that period, raise the result to the power of one divided by the number of holding periods, such as years, and subtract one from the subsequent result.
