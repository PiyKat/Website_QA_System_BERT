 Standard Deviation . Standard deviation is essentially a reflection of the amount of variability within a given data set. It shows the extent to which the individual data points in a data set vary from the mean. In investing, a large standard deviation means that more of your data points deviate from the norm, so, the investment will either outperform or underperform similar securities. A small standard deviation means that more of your data points are clustered near the norm and returns will be closer to the expected results. Standard Deviation . Investors expect a benchmark index fund to have a low standard deviation. However, with growth funds, the deviation should be higher as the management will make aggressive moves to capture returns. As with other investments, higher returns equate to higher investment risks. Standard Deviation . The standard deviation can be visualized as a bell curve, with a flatter, more spread-out bell curve representing a large standard deviation and a steep, tall bell curve representing a small standard deviation. Standard Deviation . To calculate standard deviation, first, calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. The differences are then squared, summed and averaged to produce the variance. The standard deviation, then, is the square root of the variance, which brings it back to the original unit of measure. Standard Deviation . In investing, standard deviation and Z-score can be useful tools in determining market volatility. As the standard deviation increases, it indicates thatÂ price action varies widely within the established time frame. Given this information, the Z-score of a particular price indicates how typical or atypical this movement is based on previous performance.
