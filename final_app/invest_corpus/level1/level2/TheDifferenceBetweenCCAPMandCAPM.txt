 The Difference Between CCAPM and CAPM . While the CAPM formula relies on the market portfolio's return to predict future asset prices, the CCAPM relies on aggregate consumption. In the CAPM, the market return is typically represented by the return on the S&P 500. Risky assets create uncertainty in an investor's wealth, which is determined in the CAPM by the market portfolio using the market's beta of 1.0. CAPM assumes that an investor cares about the market return and how his portfolio's return varies from that return benchmark. The Difference Between CCAPM and CAPM . In the CCAPM formula, on the other hand, risky assets create uncertainty in consumptionâ€”how much a person will spend becomes uncertain because the level of wealth is uncertain due to investments in risky assets. The CCAPM assumes investors are more concerned about how their portfolio returns vary from a different benchmark than the overall market.
