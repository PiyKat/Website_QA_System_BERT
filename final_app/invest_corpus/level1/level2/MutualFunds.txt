 Mutual Funds . MFS Investment Management offered the first U.S. mutual fund in 1924. Since the 1920s mutual funds have been providing investors an extensive selection of pooled fund offerings. While some mutual funds are passively managed, many investors look to these securities for the added value they can offer in an actively managed strategy. For these investors, active management is the key differentiator as they rely on a professional manager to build an optimal portfolio rather than just following an index.
