 Understanding Fiduciary Duties . A fiduciary's responsibilities or duties are both ethical and legal. When a party knowingly accepts the fiduciary duty on behalf of another party, they are required to act in the best interest of the principal, the party whose assets they are managing. This is what is known as a "prudent person standard of care," a standard that originally stems from an 1830 court ruling.  Understanding Fiduciary Duties . This formulation of the prudent-person rule required that a person acting as fiduciary was required to act first and foremost with the needs of beneficiaries in mind. Strict care must be taken to ensure no conflict of interest arises between the fiduciary and their principal.
