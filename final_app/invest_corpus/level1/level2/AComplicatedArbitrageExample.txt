 A Complicated Arbitrage Example . Though this is not the most complicated arbitrage strategy in use, this example of triangular arbitrage is more complex than the above example. In triangular arbitrage, a trader converts one currency to another at one bank, converts that second currency to another at a second bank, and finally converts the third currency back to the original at a third bank. The same bank would have the information efficiency to ensure all of its currency rates were aligned, requiring the use of different financial institutions for this strategy. A Complicated Arbitrage Example . For example, assume you begin with $2 million. You see that at three different institutions the following currency exchange rates are immediately available: A Complicated Arbitrage Example . First, you would convert the $2 million to euros at the 0.894 rate, giving you 1,788,000 euros. Next, you would take the 1,788,000 euros and convert them to pounds at the 1.276 rate, giving you 1,401,254 pounds. Next, you would take the pounds and convert them back to U.S. dollars at the 1.432 rate, giving you $2,006,596. Your total risk-free arbitrage profit would be $6,596.
