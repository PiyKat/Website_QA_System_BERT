 Example of the Least Squares Method . An example of the least squares method is an analyst who wishes to test the relationship between a companyâ€™s stock returns, and the returns of the index for which the stock is a component. In this example, the analyst seeks to test the dependence of the stock returns on the index returns. To achieve this, all of the returns are plotted on a chart. The index returns are then designated as the independent variable, and the stock returns are the dependent variable. The line of best fit provides the analyst with coefficients explaining the level of dependence.
