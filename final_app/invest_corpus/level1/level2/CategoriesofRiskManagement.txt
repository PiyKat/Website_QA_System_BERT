 Categories of Risk Management . Beyond the particular measures, risk management is divided into two broad categories: systematic and unsystematic risk. Categories of Risk Management . Systematic risk is associated with the market. This risk affects the overall market of the security. It is unpredictable and undiversifiable; however, the risk can be mitigated through hedging. For example, political upheaval is a systematic risk that can affect multiple financial markets, such as the bond, stock, and currency markets. An investor can hedge against this sort of risk by buying put options in the market itself. Categories of Risk Management . The second category of risk, unsystematic risk, is associated with a company or sector. It is also known as diversifiable risk and can be mitigated through asset diversification. This risk is only inherent to a specific stock or industry. If an investor buys an oil stock, he assumes the risk associated with both the oil industry and the company itself. Categories of Risk Management . For example, suppose an investor is invested in an oil company, and he believes the falling price of oil affects the company. The investor may look to take the opposite side of, or hedge, his position by buying a put option on crude oil or on the company, or he may look to mitigate the risk through diversification by buying stock in retail or airline companies. He mitigates some of the risk if he takes these routes to protect his exposure to the oil industry. If he is not concerned with risk management, the company's stock and oil price could drop significantly, and he could lose his entire investment, severely impacting his portfolio.
