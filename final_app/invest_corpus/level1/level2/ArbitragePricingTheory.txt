 Arbitrage Pricing Theory . The APT serves as an alternative to the CAPM, and it uses fewer assumptions and may be harder to implement than the CAPM. Ross developed the APT on the basis that the prices of securities are driven by multiple factors, which could be grouped into macroeconomic or company-specific factors. Unlike the CAPM, the APT does not indicate the identity or even the number of risk factors. Instead, for any multifactor model assumed to generate returns, which follows a return-generating process, the theory gives the associated expression for the asset’s expected return. While the CAPM formula requires the input of the expected market return, the APT formula uses an asset's expected rate of return and the risk premium of multiple macroeconomic factors. Arbitrage Pricing Theory . In the APT model, an asset's or a portfolio's returns follow a factor intensity structure if the returns could be expressed using this formula: ri = ai + βi1 * F1 + βi2 * F2 + ... + βkn * Fn + εi, where ai is a constant for the asset; F is a systematic factor, such as a macroeconomic or company-specific factor; β is the sensitivity of the asset or portfolio in relation to the specified factor; and εi is the asset's idiosyncratic random shock with an expected mean of zero, also known as the error term. Arbitrage Pricing Theory . The APT formula is E(ri) = rf + βi1 * RP1 + βi2 * RP2 + ... + βkn * RPn, where rf is the risk-free rate of return, β is the sensitivity of the asset or portfolio in relation to the specified factor and RP is the risk premium of the specified factor.
