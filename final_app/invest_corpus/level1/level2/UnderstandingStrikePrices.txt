 Understanding Strike Prices . Strike prices are used in derivatives (mainly options) trading. Derivatives are financial products whose value is based (derived) on the underlying asset, usually another financial instrument. The strike price is a key variable of call and put options. For example, the buyer of a stock option call would have the right, but not the obligation, to buy that stock in the future at the strike price. Similarly, the buyer of a stock option put would have the right, but not the obligation, to sell that stock in the future at the strike price. Understanding Strike Prices . The strike. or exercise price, is the most important determinant of option value. Strike prices are established when a contract is first written. It tells the investor what price the underlying asset must reach before the option is in-the-money (ITM). Strike prices are standardized, meaning they are at fixed dollar amounts, such as $31, $32, $33, $102.50, $105 and so on. Understanding Strike Prices . The price difference between the underlying stock price and the strike price determines an option's value. For buyers of a call option, if the strike price is above the underlying stock price, the option is out of the money (OTM). In this case, the option doesn't have intrinsic value, but it may still have value based on volatility and time until expiration as either of these two factors could put the option in the money in the future. Conversely, If the underlying stock price is above the strike price, the option will have intrinsic value and be in the money. Understanding Strike Prices . A buyer of a put option will be in the money when the underlying stock price is below the strike price and be out of the money when the underlying stock price is above the strike price. Again, an OTM option won't have intrinsic value, but it may still have value based on the volatility of the underlying asset and the time left until option expiration.
