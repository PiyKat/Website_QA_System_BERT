 The Difference Between Average Return and Geometric Average . When looking at the average historical returns, the geometric average is a more precise calculation. The geometric mean is always lower than the average return. One benefit of using the geometric mean is that the actual amounts invested do not need to be known. the calculation focuses entirely on the return figures themselves and presents an "apples to apples" comparison when looking at two or more investments' performance over more various time periods. The Difference Between Average Return and Geometric Average . The geometric average return is sometimes called the time-weighted rate of return (TWRR) because it eliminates the distorting effects on growth rates created by various inflows and outflows of money into an account over time. The Difference Between Average Return and Geometric Average . Alternatively, the money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) incorporates the size and timing of cash flows, so it is an effective measure for returns on a portfolio that has received deposits, dividend reinvestments, interest payments, or has had withdrawals. The money-weighted return is equivalent to the internal rate of return where the net present value equals zero.
