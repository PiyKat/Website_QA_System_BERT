 Understanding Systematic Risk . Systematic risk underlies other investment risks, such as industry risk. If an investor has placed too much emphasis on cybersecurity stocks, for example, it is possible to diversify by investing in a range of stocks in other sectors, such as healthcare and infrastructure. Systematic risk, however, incorporates interest rate changes, inflation, recessions and wars, among other major changes.Â Shifts in these domains can affect the entire market and cannot be mitigated by changing around positions within a portfolio of public equities.
