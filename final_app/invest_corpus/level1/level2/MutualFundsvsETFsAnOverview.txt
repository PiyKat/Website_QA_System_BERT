 Mutual Funds vs. ETFs: An Overview . Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are both created from the concept of pooled fund investing, often adhering to a passive, indexed strategy that tries to track or replicate representative benchmark indices. Pooled funds bundle securities together to offer investors the benefit of a diversified portfolio. The pooled fund concept primarily offers diversification and comes with economies of scale, allowing managers to decrease transaction costs through large lot share transactions with pooled investment capital.
