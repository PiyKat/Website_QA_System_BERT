 The Uses of Equity Issuance . Equity is used as capital for a company, which could be to purchase assets and fund operations. Stockholder equity has two main sources. The first is from the money initially invested in a company and additional investments made later. In the public markets, the first time a company issues shares on the primary market, this equity is used to either start operations, or in the case of an established company, for growth capital. The funds from the issuance of equity could also be used to pay off debt or acquire another company.
