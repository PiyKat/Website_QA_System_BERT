 What is a Portfolio Manager . A portfolio manager is a person or group of people responsible for investing a mutual, exchange-traded or closed-end fund's assets, implementing its investment strategy and managing day-to-day portfolio trading. A portfolio manager is one of the most important factors to consider when looking at fund investing. Portfolio management can be active or passive, and historical performance records indicate that only a minority of active fund managers consistently beat the market.
