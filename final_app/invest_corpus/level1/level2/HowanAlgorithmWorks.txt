 How an Algorithm Works . Financial companies use algorithms in areas such as loan pricing, stock trading, asset-liability management, and many automated functions. For example, algorithmic trading, known as "algo" trading, is used for deciding the timing, pricing, and quantity of stock orders.Â Algo trading, also known as automated trading or black-box trading, uses a computer program to buy or sell securities at a pace not possible for humans. How an Algorithm Works . Since prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities appear in various formats online and in trading data, the process by which an algorithm digests scores of financial data becomes easy. The user of the program simply sets the parameters and gets the desired output when securities meet the trader's criteria. How an Algorithm Works . Computer algorithms make life easier by trimming the time it takes to manually do things. In the world of automation, algorithms allow workers to be more proficient and focused. Algorithms make slow processes more proficient. In many cases, especially in automation, algos save companies money.
