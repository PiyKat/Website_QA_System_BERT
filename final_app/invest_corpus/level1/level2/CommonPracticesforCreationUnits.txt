 Common Practices for Creation Units . The State Street Global Advisors SPDR Series is one of the largest in the market for ETF sector investing and offers an example of how creation units are utilized. All funds in the Series have the same creation unit provisions. The Series issues creation units of each sector fund at the fund company’s discretion to market makers or other broker-dealers. Creation units are issued in blocks of 50,000 shares. Financial institutions provide in-kind securities and/or cash for the market value of the creation unit. Creation unit transactions are facilitated by ALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc.
