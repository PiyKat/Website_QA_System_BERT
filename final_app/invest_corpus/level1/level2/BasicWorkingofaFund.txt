 Basic Working of a Fund . A fund works by collecting money from a large number of investors. It then uses the collected capital to invest in a variety of stocks and other financial securities that fit the investment objective of the fund. Each investor gets a specified number of shares in proportion to their invested amount, and they are free to sell (redeem the value of) their fund shares at a later date and pocket the profit/loss. Since regular buying and selling (investment and redemption) of fund shares start after the launch of the fund, a mechanism is required to price the shares of the fund. This pricing mechanism is based on NAV.
