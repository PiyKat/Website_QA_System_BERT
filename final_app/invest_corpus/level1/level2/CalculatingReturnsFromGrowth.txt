 Calculating Returns From Growth . The simple growth rate is a function of the beginning and ending values or balances. It is calculated by subtracting the ending value from the beginning value and then dividing by the beginning value. The formula is as follows: Calculating Returns From Growth . ﻿Growth Rate=BV−EVBVwhere:BV=Beginning ValueEV=Ending Value\begin{aligned} &\text{Growth Rate} = \dfrac{\text{BV} -\text{EV}}{\text{BV}}\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{BV} = \text{Beginning Value}\\ &\text{EV} = \text{Ending Value}\\ \end{aligned}​Growth Rate=BVBV−EV​where:BV=Beginning ValueEV=Ending Value​﻿ Calculating Returns From Growth . For example, if you invest $10,000 in a company and the stock price increases from $50 to $100, the return can be calculated by taking the difference between $100 and $50 and then dividing by $50. The answer is 100 percent, which means you now have $20,000.
