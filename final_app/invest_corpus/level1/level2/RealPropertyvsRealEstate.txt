 Real Property vs. Real Estate . Since real property is land and anything that is immovable upon it, there can be somewhat of a grey area when it comes to real estate. The definition of real estate is "property in buildings and land," which makes it real property. However, there are some legal issues that can take place when a landowner decides a piece of real property does not apply to the sale price of real estate or vice versa.
