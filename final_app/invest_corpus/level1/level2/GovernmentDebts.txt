 Government Debts . Debt issued by a smaller government entity, such as a municipality, may also have the full faith and credit of the issuer. General obligation (GO) municipal bonds are payable from the municipality’s general funds and are backed by the full faith and credit of the municipal issuer which may have the unlimited authority to tax residents to pay bondholders. Government Debts . On rare occasions, the federal government may step in to back a portion of the payment obligations of municipalities by its full faith and credit. For example, during the credit crisis in 2009, investors shied away from muni bonds. To encourage lenders to invest in these securities the government the U.S. Treasury subsidized 35% of interest payments to investors and municipal issuers through a bond program known as the Build America Bonds. Government Debts . The government also has the power to back debt obligations of government-sponsored agencies by its full faith and credit. When this occurs, the agency takes on the backer's credit quality, in this case, the U.S. government. Government Debts . The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) is one example of a government agency that is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Securities backed by Ginnie Mae mortgages have lower yields than other mortgage-backed securities (MBS) because they are assumed to carry less risk due to the federal government’s backing.
