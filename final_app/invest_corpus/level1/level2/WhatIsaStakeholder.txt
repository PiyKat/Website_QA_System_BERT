 What Is a Stakeholder? . A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a companyÂ and can either affect or be affected by the business. The primary stakeholders in a typical corporation are its investors, employees, customers and suppliers. However, the modern theory of the idea goes beyond this original notion to include additional stakeholders such as a community, government or trade association.
