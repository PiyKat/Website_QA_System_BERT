 Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . Assume that an investor believes Apple Inc. (AAPL) will be relatively flat in terms of price over the next two months. They decide to implement an iron condor. The stock is currently trading at $212.26. Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . They sell a call with a $215 strike, which gives them $7.63 in premium. They buy a call with a strike of $220, which costs them $5.35. The credit on these two legs is $2.28, or $228 for one contract (100 shares). The trade is only half complete, though. Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . In addition, the trader sells a put with a strike of $210, resulting in a premium received of $7.20. They also buy a put with a strike of $205, costing $5.52. The net credit on these two legs is $1.68 or $168 if trading one contract on each. Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . The total credit for the position is $3.96 ($2.28 + $1.68), or $396. This is the maximum profit the trader can make. This maximum profit occurs if all the options expire worthless, which means the price must be between $215 and $210 when expiration occurs in two months. If the price is above $215 or below $210, the trader could still make a reduced profit, but could also lose money. Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . The loss gets larger if the price of Apple stock approaches the upper call strike ($220) or the lower put strike ($205). The maximum loss occurs if the price of the stock trades above $220 or below $205. Example of an Iron Condor on a Stock . Assume the stock at expiration is $225. This is above the upper call strike price, which means the trader is facing the maximum possible loss. The sold call is losing $10 ($225 - $215) while the bought call is making $5 ($225 - $220). The puts expire. The trader loses $5, or $500 total (100 share contracts), but they also received $396 in premiums. Therefore, the loss is capped at $104 plus commissions.
