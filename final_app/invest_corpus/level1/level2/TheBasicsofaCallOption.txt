 The Basics of a Call Option . Call options can be used by investors to benefit from upward moves in a stock's price. If exercised before the expiration date, these trading options allow the investor to buy shares at a stated price—the strike price. The option does not require the holder to purchase the shares if they choose not to. Traders who believe a particular stock is favorable for an upward price movement will use call options. The Basics of a Call Option . The bullish investor would pay an upfront fee—the premium—for the call option. Premiums base their price on the spread between the stock's current market price and the strike price. If the option's strike price is near the stock's current market price, the premium will likely be expensive. The strike price is the price at which the option gets converted to the stock at expiry. The Basics of a Call Option . Should the underlying asset fall to less than the strike price, the holder will not buy the stock but will lose the value of the premium at expiration. If the share price moves above the strike price the holder may decide to purchase shares at that price but are under no obligation to do so. Again, in this scenario, the holder would be out the price of the premium. The Basics of a Call Option . An expensive premium might make a call option not worth buying since the stock's price would have to move significantly higher to offset the premium paid. Called the break-even point (BEP), this is the price equal to the strike price plus the premium fee. The Basics of a Call Option . The broker will charge a fee for placing an options trade and this expense factors into the overall cost of the trade. Also, options contracts are priced by lots of 100 shares. So, buying one contract equates to 100 shares of the underlying asset.
