 Understanding Notional Value . Notional value is integral in assessing portfolio risk which can be very useful when determining hedge ratios to offset that risk. For example, a fund has a $1,000,000 long exposure to US equity market and the fund manager wants to offset that risk using the E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts. They would have to sell an approximately equivalent amount of S&P 500 futures contracts to hedge their market exposure risk. Using the above example, the notional value of each E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is $140,000 and the market value is $10,000. Understanding Notional Value . Hedge Ratio = Cash Exposure Risk ÷ Notional Value of Related Underlying Asset Understanding Notional Value . Hedge Ratio = $1,000,000 ÷ $140,000 = 7.14 Understanding Notional Value . So, the fund manager would sell approximately 7 E-mini S&P 500 contracts to effectively hedge their long cash position against market risk. The market value (cost) would be $70,000. Understanding Notional Value . While notional value can be used in futures and stocks (total value of the stock position) in the ways discussed above, notional value also applies to interest rate swaps, total return swaps, equity options, and foreign currency derivatives.
