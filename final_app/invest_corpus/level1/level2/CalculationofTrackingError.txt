 Calculation of Tracking Error . Tracking error is the standard deviation of the difference between the returns of an investment and its benchmark. Given a sequence of returns for an investment or portfolio and its benchmark, tracking error is calculated as follows: Calculation of Tracking Error .  Tracking Error = Standard Deviation of (P - B) Calculation of Tracking Error . For example, assume that there is a large-cap mutual fund benchmarked to the S&P 500 index. Next, assume that the mutual fund and the index realized the following returns over a given five-year period: Calculation of Tracking Error . Mutual Fund: 11%, 3%, 12%, 14% and 8%. Calculation of Tracking Error . S&P 500 index: 12%, 5%, 13%, 9% and 7%. Calculation of Tracking Error . Given this data, the series of differences is then (11% - 12%), (3% - 5%), (12% - 13%), (14% - 9%) and (8% - 7%). These differences equal -1%, -2%, -1%, 5%, and 1%. The standard deviation of this series of differences, the tracking error, is 2.79%.
