 A Note About Fund Dividends . Dividends paid by funds are different from dividends paid by companies. Funds for company dividends usually come from profits that are generated from the company's business operations. Funds work on the principle of net asset value (NAV), which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the price of the asset(s) a fund may be tracking. Since funds donâ€™t have any intrinsic profits, they pay dividends that are sourced from their NAV. A Note About Fund Dividends . Due to the NAV-based working of funds, regular and high-frequency dividend payments should not be misunderstood as a stellar performance by the fund. Say a bond investing fund may pay monthly dividends as it receives money in the form of monthly interest on its interest-bearing holdings. It is merely transferring the interest income fully or partially to the fund investors. A stock investing fund may also pay dividends, which may come from the dividend(s) it receives from the stocks held in its portfolio, or by selling a certain quantity of stocks. Essentially, the investors receiving the dividend from the fund are reducing their holding value, which gets reflected in the reduced NAV on the ex-date.
