 Do Tobacco Taxes Work? . There is some debate about whether high taxes on products like tobacco work — and that depends on who you ask. The Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education does admit that tobacco taxes contribute to the reduction of smoking and tobacco use in general but says it does not find them very effective. The reason being that since the tax affects the price, small increases will not necessarily dissuade consumers from buying tobacco products. And in these cases — with smaller tax hikes — cigarette companies may even lower their prices to compensate. The increase would, therefore, have to be so large that it would deter consumers from making future purchases and dissuade companies from lowering their prices.  Do Tobacco Taxes Work? . But supporters of cigarette taxes say otherwise. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these taxes are the most effective way to reduce consumption and demand. The organization says that higher prices have led to more people quitting and they reduce the chances of a former smoker relapsing. WHO says that, on average, a 10 percent increase in price (including taxes) would account for a 4 percent drop in demand in high-income countries and a 5 percent drop in low- and middle-income countries.
