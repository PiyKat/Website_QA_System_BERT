 S&P 500 Index Futures . The first S&P 500 futures contracts were introduced by the CME in 1982. The CME added the E-mini option in 1997. The SP contract is the base market contract for S&P 500 futures trading. It is priced by multiplying the S&P 500’s value by $250. For example, if the S&P 500 is at a level of 2,500, then the market value of a futures contract is 2,500 x $250 or $625,000. S&P 500 Index Futures . E-mini futures were created to allow for smaller investments by a wider range of investors. The S&P 500 E-Mini Futures are one-fifth of the value of the big contract. If the S&P 500 level is 2,500 then the market value of a futures contract is 2,500 x $50 or $125,000. The "E" in E-mini stands for electronic. Many traders favor the S&P 500 E-Mini ES over the SP not only for its smaller investment size but also for its liquidity. Like its name, the E-Mini ES trades electronically which can be more efficient than the open outcry pit trading for the SP. S&P 500 Index Futures . As with all futures, investors are only required to front a fraction of the contract value to take a position. This represents the margin on the futures contract. These margins are not the same as margins for stock trading. Futures margins show "skin in the game" that must be offset or settled.
