 Real World Example of Hypothesis Testing . If, for example, a person wants to test that a penny has exactly a 50% chance of landing on heads, the null hypothesis would be yes, and the alternative hypothesis would be no (it does not land on heads). Mathematically, the null hypothesis would be represented as Ho: P = 0.5. The alternative hypothesis would be denoted as "Ha" and be identical to the null hypothesis, except with the equal sign struck-through, meaning that it does not equal 50%. Real World Example of Hypothesis Testing . A random sample of 100 coin flips is taken from a random population of coin flippers, and the null hypothesis is then tested. If it is found that the 100 coin flips were distributed as 40 heads and 60 tails, the analyst would assume that a penny does not have a 50% chance of landing on heads and would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. Afterward, a new hypothesis would be tested, this time that a penny has a 40% chance of landing on heads.
