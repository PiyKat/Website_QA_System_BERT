 BREAKING DOWN Portfolio Manager . A portfolio manager holds great influence on a fund, no matter if that fund is a closed or open mutual fund, hedge fund, venture capital fund or exchange-traded fund. The manager of the fund's portfolio will directly affect the overall returns of the fund. Portfolio managers, therefore, are usually experienced investors, brokers or traders, with strong backgrounds in financial management and track records of sustained success. BREAKING DOWN Portfolio Manager . A portfolio manager, regardless of background, is either an active manager or passive manager. If a manager takes a passive approach, his investment strategy mirrors a specific market index. With these funds, the market index used as a benchmark is extremely important since an investor should expect to see similar returns over the long term. BREAKING DOWN Portfolio Manager . Conversely, a manager can take an active approach to investing; meaning that he attempts to consistently beat average market returns. In this scenario, the portfolio manager himself is extremely important, since his investment style directly results in the fund's returns. Potential investors should look at the active fund's marketing material for more information on the investment approach.
