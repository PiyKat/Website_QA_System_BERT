 Bucketing . Bucket or segmentation strategies divide assets into different “buckets,” depending on the time remaining until withdrawal and the client’s risk appetite. For example, the first bucket may contain cash and cash equivalents needed over the next five years, while the last bucket may contain riskier equities that won’t have to be sold for a decade or more. These buckets can be rebalanced at any time to reflect changes in income requirements or risk tolerance. (For more, see: Will a Systematic Withdrawal Plan Work for You?)
