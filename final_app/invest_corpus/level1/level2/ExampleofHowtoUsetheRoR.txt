 Example of How to Use the RoR . The rate of return can be calculated for any investment, dealing with any kind of asset. Let's take the example of purchasing a home as a basic example for understanding how to calculate the RoR. Say that you buy a house for $250,000 (for simplicity let's assume you pay 100% cash). Example of How to Use the RoR . Six years later, you decide to sell the house—maybe your family is growing and you need to move into a larger place. You are able to sell the house for $335,000, after deducting any realtor's fees and taxes. The simple rate of return on the purchase and sale of the house is as follows: Example of How to Use the RoR . ﻿(335,000−250,000)250,000×100=34%\frac{(335,000-250,000)}{250,000} \times 100 = 34\%250,000(335,000−250,000)​×100=34%﻿ Example of How to Use the RoR . Now, what if, instead, you sold the house for less than you paid for it—say, for $187,500? The same equation can be used to calculate your loss, or the negative rate of return, on the transaction:  Example of How to Use the RoR . ﻿(187,500−250,000)250,000×100=−25%\frac{(187,500 - 250,000)}{250,000} \times 100 = -25\%250,000(187,500−250,000)​×100=−25%﻿
