 Example of Delta-Gamma Hedging Using the Underlying Stock . Assume a trader is long one call of a stock, and the option has a delta of 0.6. That means that for each $1 the stock price moves up or down, the option premium will increase or decrease $0.60, respectively. To hedge the delta, the trader needs to short 60 shares of stock (one contract x 100 shares x 0.6 delta). Being short 60 shares neutralizes the effect of the positive 0.6 delta. Example of Delta-Gamma Hedging Using the Underlying Stock . As the price of the stock changes, so will the delta. At-the-money options have a delta near 0.5. The deeper in-the-money an option goes, the closer delta gets to one. The deeper out-of-the-money an option goes, the closer it gets to zero. Example of Delta-Gamma Hedging Using the Underlying Stock . Assume that the gamma on this position is 0.2. That means that for each dollar change in the stock, the delta changes by 0.2. To offest the change in delta (gamma) the prior delta hedge needs to be adjusted. If delta increases by 0.2, then delta is now 0.8. That means the trader needs 80 short shares to offset delta. They already shorted 60, so they need to short 20 more. If delta decreased by 0.2, the delta is now 0.4, so the trader only needs 40 shares short. They have 60, so they can buy 20 shares back. Example of Delta-Gamma Hedging Using the Underlying Stock . Gamma hedging is essentially constantly readjusting the delta hedge as delta changes (gamma).
