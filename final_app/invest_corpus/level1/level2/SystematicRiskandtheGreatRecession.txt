 Systematic Risk and the Great Recession . The Great Recession also provides an example of systematic risk. Anyone who was invested in the market in 2008 saw the values of their investments change drastically from this economic event. The Great Recession affected asset classes in different ways, as riskier securities (e.g., those that were more leveraged) were sold off in large quantities, while simpler assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, became more valuable. Systematic Risk and the Great Recession . If you want to know how much systematic risk a particular security, fund or portfolio has, you can look at its beta, which measures how volatile that investment is compared to the overall market. A beta of greater than 1 means the investment has more systematic risk than the market, while less than 1 means less systematic risk than the market. A beta equal to one means the investment carries the same systematic risk as the market. Systematic Risk and the Great Recession . The opposite of systematic risk,Â unsystematic risk, affects a very specific group of securities or an individual security. Unsystematic risk can be mitigated through diversification.
