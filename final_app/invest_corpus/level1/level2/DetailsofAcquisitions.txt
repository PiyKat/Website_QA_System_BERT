 Details of Acquisitions . Like some merger deals, in acquisitions, a company may buy another company with cash, stock or a combination of the two. And in smaller deals, it is common for one company to acquire all of another company's assets. Company X buys all of Company Y's assets for cash, which means that Company Y will have only cash (and debt, if any). Of course, Company Y becomes merely a shell and will eventually liquidate or enter other areas of business. Details of Acquisitions . Another acquisition deal known as a "reverse merger" enables a private company to become publicly-listed in a relatively short time period. Reverse mergers occur when a private company that has strong prospects and is eager to acquire financing buys a publicly-listed shell company, with no legitimate business operations and limited assets. The private company reverses merges into the public company, and together they become an entirely new public corporation with tradeable shares.
